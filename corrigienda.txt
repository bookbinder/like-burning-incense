*  Week1 Monday Evening Prayer, Antiphon 3, in original, the accompanying tone 
   to this antiphon doesn't have the e in the soprano.
*  Week1 Wednesday Evening Prayer, Antiphon 2, second note in tenor is either
   d-flat or c
*  Week1 Friday Evening Prayer, Magnificat, last measure of antiphon is unclear
   in the original
*  Week1, Saturday Morning Prayer, Psalm 3, ended up using a different psalm
   tone than in the original because I couldn't find the original psalm tone

   because I couldn't find the original
