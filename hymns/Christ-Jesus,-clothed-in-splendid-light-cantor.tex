\begin{underhymnverse}
To you, O Christ, we lift our voice:\\
Protect us all, we humbly pray,\\
and fill our minds and hearts with light,\\
that cleansed, we all may live for you.

All glory be to you, O Christ;\\
the Father and the Spirit blest,\\
in splendor from the heights of heav’n,\\
reveal that you are Light and Truth. Amen.
\end{underhymnverse}
