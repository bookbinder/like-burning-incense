\begin{underhymnverse}
%% Eternal Author of the world,\\
%% who rule and order night and day,\\
%% you measure seasons by the hours\\
%% to lift our weary minds and hearts.

%% The herald of the day now cries,\\
%% all watchful through the darkest hours;\\
%% nocturnal light for those who roam,\\
%% he marks the watches of the night.

%% He crows: the morning star awakes\\
%% and rids the skies of night and gloom;\\
%% he crows: all roving errant bands\\
%% forsake their paths of vice and harm.

%% He crows: the sailor gathers strength,\\
%% and storms on foaming seas grow calm;\\
%% he crows: the Church’s rock himself\\
%% by bitter tears dissolves his sin.

\flagverse{\footnotesize\textbf{5.}}O Jesus, heed us as we fall,\\
correct us by your loving gaze,\\
for if you look, transgressions fail\\
and tears release us from our guilt.

\flagverse{\footnotesize\textbf{6.}}Shine forth your light upon our hearts,\\
shake off the slumber from our souls,\\
and let our voice first sound your praise\\
as we fulfill our vows to you.

\flagverse{\footnotesize\textbf{7.}}O Christ, to you, most loving King,\\
and to the Father glory be,\\
one with the Spirit Paraclete,\\
from age to age for evermore. Amen.
