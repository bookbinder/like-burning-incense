\begin{underhymnverse}
\flagverse{\footnotesize\textbf{5.}}
She brought to birth her holy child,\\
whose advent Gabriel proclaimed,\\
whose presence John perceived with joy\\
and leapt within his mother’s womb.

\flagverse{\footnotesize\textbf{6.}}
He lay on straw with no complaint,\\
not shrinking from a manger bed;\\
an infant’s share of milk he drank,\\
while in his care he fed the birds.

\flagverse{\footnotesize\textbf{7.}}
The hosts on high exult with joy\\
and angels sing to God with praise;\\
the shepherds wondrously behold\\
the Shepherd, Maker of all things.

\flagverse{\footnotesize\textbf{8.}}
To you, Lord Jesus, glory be,\\
the Virgin Mother’s newborn Son,\\
with God the Father, ever blest,\\
and loving Spirit, ever one. Amen.
