\begin{underhymnverse}
\flagverse{\footnotesize\textbf{5.}}May he direct and rule our minds,\\
in bodies faithful, chaste, and pure;\\
may faith enkindled never know\\
the deadly poison of deceit.

\flagverse{\footnotesize\textbf{6.}}Let Christ himself become our food,\\
our faith in him become our drink;\\
let us imbibe with deepest joy\\
the Spirit’s sober drunkenness.

\flagverse{\footnotesize\textbf{7.}}Then let this day proceed with joy:\\
our modesty be like the dawn,\\
our faith resplendent as the noon,\\
our soul untouched by dusk and night.

\flagverse{\footnotesize\textbf{8.}}The dawn rides forth along her course;\\
so let our perfect dawn arise:\\
both Son in Father wholly one,\\
and Father wholly in his Word. Amen.
