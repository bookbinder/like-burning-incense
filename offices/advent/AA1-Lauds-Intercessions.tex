To God our Father. who has given us the grace to wait in joyful hope for the revelation or our Lord Jesus Christ, let us make our prayer:\\
\emph{Show us your mercy, Lord.}

\medskip Sanctify us in mind and body,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}keep us without sin until the coming of your Son.

\medskip Make us walk this day in holiness,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}and live upright and devout lives in this world.

\medskip May we be clothed in our Lord Jesus Christ,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}and filled with the Holy Spirit.

\medskip Lord, help us to stand watchful and ready,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}until your Son is revealed in all his glory.
