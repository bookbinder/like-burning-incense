All-powerful God,\\
increase our strength of will for doing good\\

Grant your faithful, we pray, almighty God,\\
the resolve to run forth to meet your Christ\\
with righteous deeds at his coming,\\
so that, gathered at his right hand,\\
they may be worthy to possess the heavenly kingdom.\\
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\\
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
