To Jesus Christ, our Redeemer, the way, the truth, and the life, let us make our humble prayer:\\
\emph{Come and stay with us, Lord.}

\medskip Son of the Most High, your coming was announced to the Virgin Mary by Gabriel,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}come and rule over your people for ever.

\medskip Holy One of God, in your presence John the Baptist leapt in Elizabethâ€™s womb,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}bring the joy of salvation to all the earth.

\medskip Jesus the Savior, the angel revealed your name to Joseph the just man,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}come and save your people from their sins.

\medskip Light of the world, for whom Simeon and all the just waited,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}come and comfort us.

\medskip O Rising Sun that never sets, Zechariah foretold that you would visit us from above,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}come and shine on those who dwell in darkness and the shadow of death.
