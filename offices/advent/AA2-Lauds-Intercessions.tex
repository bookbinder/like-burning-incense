Christ the Lord, Son of the living God, light from light, leads us into the light and reveals the holiness of God. With confidence we make our prayer:\\
\emph{Come, Lord Jesus.}

\medskip Light that never fades, dispel the mists about us,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}awaken our faith from sleep.

\medskip Guard us from all harm today,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}may your glory fill us with joy.

\medskip Give us unfailing gentleness at all times,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}toward everyone we meet.

\medskip Come to create a new earth for us,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}where there will be justice and peace.
