Lord our God,\\
help us to prepare\\
for the coming of Christ your Son.\\
May he find us waiting,\\

\begin{verse}
Keep us alert, we pray, O Lord our God,\\
as we await the advent of Christ your Son,\\
so that, when he comes and knocks,\\
he may find us watchful in prayer\\
and exultant in his praise.\\
Who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.
