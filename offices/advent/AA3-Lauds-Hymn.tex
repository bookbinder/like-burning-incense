\settowidth{\versewidth}{for Christ shines forth from heaven’s height.}

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Behold a voice resounding, clear,\\
rebuking hidden fears and deeds:\\
Let dreams be driven far away,\\
for Christ shines forth from heaven’s height.

Now let the weary soul arise,\\
infirm and wounded by her sin;\\
a new star now sends forth its light\\
to rid the world of ev’ry harm.

The Lamb is sent from realms on high\\
to free us from our mortal debt.\\
Let ev’ry voice give thankful praise\\
and weep for tender mercy shown,

That when he comes like lightning flash\\
and terror grips the world in dread,\\
he need not punish us for guilt\\
but with compassion shield us then.

Praise to the Father, God most high,\\
all vict’ry to his only Son,\\
due honor to the Spirit blest,\\
through endless ages evermore. Amen.
\end{verse}
