Look with favor, Lord God, on our petitions,\\
and in our trials grant us your compassionate help,\\
that, consoled by the presence of your Son,\\
whose coming we now await,\\
we may be tainted no longer\\
by the corruption of former ways.\\
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\\
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.
