To the eternal Word who became man to reveal to us the new and living way, let us make our humble prayer:\\
\emph{Come, Lord, and save us.}

\medskip God, in whom we live and move and have our being,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}come and teach us that you have made us your own.

\medskip You are not far from each of us,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}show yourself to all who search for you.

\medskip Father of the poor and consoler of the afflicted,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}set captives free, give joy to those who mourn.

\medskip You hate death and love life,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}free all mankind from eternal death.
