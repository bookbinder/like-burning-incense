Through his Son, God the Father revealed his glory to men and women. Therefore, let our joyful cry resound:\\
\emph{Lord, may your name be glorified.}

\medskip Teach us, Lord, to love each other,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}as Christ loved us for Godâ€™s glory.

\medskip Fill us with all joy and peace in faith,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}that we may walk in the hope and strength of the Holy Spirit.

\medskip Help all mankind, Lord, in your loving mercy,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}be near to those who seek you without knowing it.

\medskip You call and sanctify the elect,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}though we are sinners, crown us with eternal happiness.
