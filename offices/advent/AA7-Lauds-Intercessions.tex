Let us pray to God our Father, who from of old has called his people to salvation:\\
\emph{Lord, protect your people.}

\medskip You promised to plant the seed of justice among your people,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}protect the holiness of your Church.

\medskip Lord, teach all men and women to listen to your word,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}and help believers to persevere in holiness.

\medskip Keep us in the love of your Spirit,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}that we may receive the mercy of your Son who is to come.

\medskip Father most merciful, strengthen us to the last,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}until the day of the coming of Jesus Christ our Lord.
