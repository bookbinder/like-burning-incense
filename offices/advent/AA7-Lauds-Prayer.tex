God our Father,\\
you loved the world so much\\
you gave your only Son to free us\\
from the ancient power of sin and death.\\
Help us who wait for his coming,\\
and lead us to true liberty.\\
We ask this through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\\
who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\

\begin{prayerverse}
O God, who sent your Only Begotten Son into this world\\
to free the human race from its ancient enslavement,\\
bestow on those who devoutly await him\\
the grace of your compassion from on high,\\
that we may attain the prize of true freedom.\\
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\\
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.
