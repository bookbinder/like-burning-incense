Jesus is Lord, born of the Virgin Mary. Let us pray to him with joyful hearts:\\
\emph{Come, Lord Jesus!}

\medskip Son of God, you will come again as the true messenger of the covenant,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}help the world to recognize and accept you.

\medskip Born in your Fatherâ€™s heart, you became man in the womb of the Virgin Mary,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}free us from the tyranny of change and decay.

\medskip In your life on earth, you came to die as a man,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}save us from everlasting death.

\medskip When you come to judge, show us your loving mercy,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}and forgive us our weaknesses.

\medskip Lord Jesus, by your death you have given hope to those who have died,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}be merciful to those for whom we now pray.
