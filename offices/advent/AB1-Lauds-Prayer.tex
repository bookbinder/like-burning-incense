\begin{prayerverse}
God of power and mercy,\\
open our hearts in welcome.\\
Remove the things that hinder us from receiving Christ with joy,\\
so that we may share his wisdom\\
and become one with him\\
when he comes in glory,\\
for he lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.

\begin{prayerverse}
Almighty and merciful God,\\
may no earthly undertaking hinder those\\
who set out in haste to meet your Son,\\
but may our learning of heavenly wisdom\\
gain us admittance into his company.\\
Who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.
