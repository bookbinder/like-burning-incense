\settowidth{\versewidth}{a shoot has sprung from Jesse’s stock,}

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
O Virgin Mother of our God,\\
and glorious shield of virgin souls,\\
O Gate that opens heaven’s court,\\
our hope on earth and heav’nly joy:

O Lily, fair among the thorns,\\
most lovely and all-perfect dove:\\
a shoot has sprung from Jesse’s stock,\\
the healing balm for all our wounds.

A tow’r the dragon cannot scale,\\
a star that guides those lost at sea,\\
protect us from deceit and guile,\\
direct us by your holy light.

Disperse the clouds of doubt and sin,\\
remove the shoals of shifting sand,\\
prepare a safe and sheltered path\\
for those who stray mid stormy seas.

You shine in splendor, you alone,\\
untouched by Adam’s deadly sin;\\
O Mary, be our great defense,\\
fend off the jealous serpent’s wiles.

To Father and to Paraclete\\
and to your Son all glory be,\\
who have bestowed on you alone,\\
the grace of perfect holiness. Amen.
\end{verse}
