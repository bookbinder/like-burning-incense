\begin{hangpar}

Let us praise God our Almighty Father, who wished that Mary, his Son’s mother, be celebrated by each generation. Now in need we ask:\\
\emph{Mary, full of grace, intercede for us.}

\medskip O God, worker of miracles, you made the Immaculate Virgin Mary share body and soul in your Son’s glory in heaven,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}direct the hearts of your children to that same glory.

\medskip You made Mary our mother. Through her intercession grant strength to the weak, comfort to the sorrowing, pardon to sinners,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}salvation and peace to all.

\medskip You made Mary full of grace,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}grant all men the joyful abundance of your grace.

\medskip Make your Church of one mind and one heart in love,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}and help all those who believe to be one in prayer with Mary, the mother of Jesus.

\medskip You crowned Mary queen of heaven,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}may all the dead rejoice in your kingdom with the saints for ever.
