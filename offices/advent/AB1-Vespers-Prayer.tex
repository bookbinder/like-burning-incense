\begin{verse}
Father,\\
you prepared the Virgin Mary,\\
to be the worthy mother of your Son.\\
You let her share beforehand\\
in the salvation Christ would bring by his death,\\
and kept her sinless from the first moment of her conception.\\
Help us by her prayers\\
to live in your presence without sin.\\
We ask this through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\\
who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.
\end{verse}

\noindent{\color{red}Or:}

\begin{verse}
O God, who by the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin\\
prepared a worthy dwelling for your Son,\\
grant, we pray,\\
that, as you preserved her from every stain\\
by virtue of the Death of your Son, which you foresaw,\\
so, through her intercession,\\
we, too, may be cleansed and admitted to your presence.\\
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\\
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.
\end{verse}
