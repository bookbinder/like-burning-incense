May our prayer of petition\\
rise before you, we pray, O Lord,\\
that, with purity unblemished,\\
we, your servants, may come, as we desire,\\
to celebrate the great mystery\\
of the Incarnation of your Only Begotten Son.\\
Who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
