To Christ our Lord, judge of the living and the dead, let us cry out with faith:\\
\emph{Come, Lord Jesus!}

\medskip Lord, may the world know your justice which the heavens proclaim,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}may your glory fill the earth.

\medskip For us you took upon yourself the weakness of man,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}protect us with the strength of your own divine life.

\medskip Come to those imprisoned in the darkness of ignorance,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}show them the radiance of your own divine light.

\medskip In your humility as a man, you took away our sin,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}now in your glory grant us true happiness.

\medskip When you come in glory to judge us,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}gather the dead into your kingdom.
