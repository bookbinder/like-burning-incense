To Christ our Lord, the light of the world, let us cry out with joy:\\
\emph{Come, Lord Jesus!}

\medskip Dispel our darkness with the light of your presence,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}and make us worthy of your gifts.

\medskip Save us, Lord our God,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}that we may praise your holy name this day.

\medskip Enkindle in our hearts the flame of your love,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}and make us long to be united with you.

\medskip You bore our infirmity,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}aid the sick and those who are to die this day.
