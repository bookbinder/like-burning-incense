To Christ, our Lord and Redeemer, who will appear openly on the last day, let us joyfully pray:\\
\emph{Come, Lord Jesus!}

\medskip Our Redeemer and Lord, by your birth as a man you freed us from the yoke of the law,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}complete in us the works of your loving kindness.

\medskip From us you took whatever served your divinity,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}give us whatever we need to serve you.

\medskip Grant the desire we ask of you today,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}inflame our hearts with the fire of your love.

\medskip On earth we live with you by faith,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}in glory may we rejoice with you.

\medskip Steep the souls of the faithful departed,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}in the dew of your loving kindness.
