To Jesus Christ our Lord, who came among us in his mercy, let us constantly cry out with joy:\\
\emph{Come, Lord Jesus!}

\medskip You came from the Father to take on our human nature,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}now set free what was harmed in us by sin.

\medskip One day you will come again in glory to your chosen people,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}come to us today and help us sinners to recognize your mercy and tender love.

\medskip We glory in praising you, Lord Jesus,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}come and bring us your salvation.

\medskip Through faith you lead us into light,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}may we reveal your justice through our deeds.
