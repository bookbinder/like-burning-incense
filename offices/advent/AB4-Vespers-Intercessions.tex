\begin{hangpar}

We humbly pray to Jesus Christ, who rescues us from the darkness of sin, and in faith we cry out:\\
\emph{Come, Lord Jesus!}

\medskip Lord, gather together all the people of the earth,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}and establish with them your everlasting covenant.

\medskip Lamb of God, you came of old to take away the sin of the world,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}purge us from the dregs of our guilt.

\medskip You came to recover what was lost,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}come once again in your mercy lest you punish what you have recovered.

\medskip Our faith seeks you out,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}let us find everlasting joy with you when you come.

\medskip You will judge the living and the dead,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}graciously gather the dead into the ranks of the blessed.
