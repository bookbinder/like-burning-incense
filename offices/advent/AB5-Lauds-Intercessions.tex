Let us pray to God our Father who sent his Son to save mankind:\\
\emph{Show us your mercy, Lord!}

\medskip Father most merciful, we confess our faith in your Christ with our words,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}keep us from denying him in our actions.

\medskip You have sent your Son to rescue us,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}remove every sorrow from the face of the earth and from our country.

\medskip Our land looks forward with delight to the approach of your Son,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}let it experience the fullness of your joy.

\medskip Through your mercy make us live holy and chaste lives in this world,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}eagerly awaiting the blessed hope and coming of Christ in glory.
