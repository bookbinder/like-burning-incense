\settowidth{\versewidth}{Before your strong and steadfast might,}

\begin{hymnverse}[\versewidth]
O loving Maker of the stars,\\
believers’ everlasting light,\\
O Christ, Redeemer of us all,\\
with kindness hear our humble prayer.

With pity, you beheld the fate\\
that death imposed on ages past;\\
you gave the guilty healing grace\\
and saved a weak and fallen world.

When evening fell upon the earth,\\
as bridegroom from the bridal room,\\
from honored cloister forth you came,\\
born from the Virgin Mother pure.

Before your strong and steadfast might,\\
on earth and in the heav’ns above\\
all knees bend low, all hearts confess\\
submission to your sov’reign will.

With faith we beg you, Holy Lord,\\
the Judge of ages still to come,\\
that in our time you keep us safe\\
from snares of our deceitful foe.

To you, O Christ, most loving King,\\
and to the Father, glory be,\\
one with the Spirit Paraclete,\\
from age to age for evermore. Amen
