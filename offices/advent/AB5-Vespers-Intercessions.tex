To Christ our Lord, who humbled himself for our sake, we joyfully say:\\
\emph{Come, Lord Jesus!}

\medskip Lord Jesus, by your coming you rescued the world from sin,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}cleanse our souls and bodies from guilt.

\medskip By the mystery of your incarnation we are made your brothers and sisters,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}do not let us become estranged from you. 

\medskip Do not judge harshly,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}those you redeemed with such great cost. 

\medskip No age, O Christ, is without your goodness and holy riches,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}enable us to merit the unfading crown of glory.

\medskip Lord, to you we commend the souls of your departed servants,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}having died to the world, may they be alive in you for ever.
