To Christ our Redeemer, who comes to save us from our sins, let us cry out with joy:\\
\emph{Come, Lord Jesus!}

\medskip The prophets of old foretold your birth among us,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}now make virtue come to life in us.

\medskip We proclaim your saving work,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}now grant us your salvation.

\medskip You came to heal the contrite,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}heal the weaknesses of your people.

\medskip You came and saw fit to reconcile the world,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}when you come again in judgment, free us from the torments of punishment.
