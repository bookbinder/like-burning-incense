All-powerful God,\\
help us to look forward in hope\\
to the coming of our Savior.\\
May we live as he has taught,\\
ready to welcome him with burning love.\\
We ask this through Jesus Christ our Lord,\\
who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\

\begin{verse}
Grant that your people, we pray, almighty God,\\
may be ever watchful\\
for the coming of your Only Begotten Son,\\
that, as the author of our salvation himself has taught us,\\
we may hasten, alert and with lighted lamps,\\
to meet him when he comes.\\
Who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.
\end{verse}
