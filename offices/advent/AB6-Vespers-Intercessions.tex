To our Redeemer who came to bring good news to the poor, let us earnestly pray:\\
\emph{Let all people see your glory!}

\medskip Show yourself to those who have never known you;

{\color{red}---\thinspace}let them see your saving work.

\medskip Let your name be preached to the ends of the earth,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}that all may find the way to you.

\medskip You came first to save the world;

{\color{red}---\thinspace}now come again and save those who believe in you.

\medskip You brought freedom to us by saving us;

{\color{red}---\thinspace}continue to save us and make us free.

\medskip You came once as a man; you will return in judgment;

{\color{red}---\thinspace}bring eternal reward to those who have died.
