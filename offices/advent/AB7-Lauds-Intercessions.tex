To Jesus Christ, our Redeemer, who will come again in glory with great power, let us make our humble prayer:\\
\emph{Come, Lord Jesus!}

\medskip Lord Jesus, you will come with great power,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}look on our lowliness and make us worthy of your gifts.

\medskip You came to be the good news for mankind,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}may we always proclaim your saving work.

\medskip You are worthy of praise, for you have life and rule all things,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}help us to wait in joyful hope for the coming of your glory.

\medskip We long for the grace of your coming,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}console us with the gift of your own divine life.
