Lord,\\
let your glory dawn to take away our darkness.\\

May the splendor of your glory dawn in our hearts,\\
we pray, almighty God,\\
that all shadows of the night may be scattered\\
and we may be shown to be children of light\\
by the advent of your Only Begotten Son.\\
Who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
