\settowidth{\versewidth}{and fills you now with heaven’s light,}

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Receive, O Mary, Virgin pure,\\
within your chaste and blessed womb\\
the saving Word proclaimed for all,\\
proceeding from the Father’s mouth.

The fruitful Spirit’s shadow comes\\
and fills you now with heaven’s light,\\
that you may carry Christ the Lord,\\
the Father’s own coequal Son.

She is the sacred temple gate,\\
for ever sealed and barred to all;\\
yet for the heav’nly Prince alone\\
the blessed threshold opens wide.

Foretold by prophets long ago\\
and born before the morning star,\\
the one proclaimed by Gabriel\\
is Christ the Lord come down to earth.

Rejoice together, angel hosts!\\
Let all the peoples sing for joy.\\
The Most High comes, a humble child,\\
to save and ransom what was lost.

To you, O Christ, most loving King,\\
and to the Father, glory be,\\
one with the Spirit Paraclete,\\
from age to age for evermore. Amen.
\end{verse}
