Lord,\\
hear our voices raised in prayer.\\
Let the light of the coming of your Son\\

We ask this through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\\
who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\

Incline a merciful ear to our cry, we pray, O Lord,\\

visit us with the grace of your Son.\\
Who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
