We cry to the Lord, who will come to bring us salvation:\\
\emph{Come, Lord, and save us.}

\medskip Lord Jesus Christ, our God, Savior of all,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}come swiftly and save us.

\medskip Lord, by your coming into this world,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}free us from the sin of the world.

\medskip You came from the Father,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}show us the path that leads to him.

\medskip You were conceived by the Holy Spirit,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}by your word renew the same spirit in our hearts.

\medskip You became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}free our bodies from corruption.

\medskip Lord, be mindful of all men,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}who from the beginning of time have placed their trust in you.
