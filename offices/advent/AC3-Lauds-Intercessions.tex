God the almighty Father stretches forth his hand again to take possession of the remnant of his people. Let us make our prayer to him:\\
\emph{Lord, may your kingdom come.}

\medskip Lord, grant that our works of penance may please you,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}and that we may be ready for your kingdom which is so near.

\medskip Prepare a path in our hearts for the coming of your Word,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}and let his glory be revealed among us.

\medskip Bring low the mountains of our pride,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}and fill up the valleys of our weakness.

\medskip Break down the wall of hatred that divides the nations,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}and make level for mankind the paths to peace.
