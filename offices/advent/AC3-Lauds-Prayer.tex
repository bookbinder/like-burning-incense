O God, who through your Only Begotten Son\\
have made us a new creation,\\
look kindly, we pray,\\
on the handiwork of your mercy,\\
and at your Sonâ€™s coming\\
cleanse us from every stain of the old way of life.\\
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\\
 who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.
