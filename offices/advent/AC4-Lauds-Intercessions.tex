The Word of God humbled himself to dwell with us so that we might see his glory. Rejoicing in hope, let us call upon him:\\
\emph{Emmanuel, be with us.}

\medskip Ruler, just and righteous,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}bring justice to the poor and the oppressed.

\medskip King of peace, you beat swords into plowshares and spears into pruning hooks,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}turn hatred into love and our grievances into forgiveness.

\medskip You do not judge by appearances,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}recognize those who are your own.

\medskip When you come with power and might upon the clouds,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}grant that we may come before you without shame.
