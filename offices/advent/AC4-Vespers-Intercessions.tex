Let us pray to God the Father, who sent his Son to bring us endless peace:\\
\emph{Lord, your kingdom come.}

\medskip Father most holy, look kindly on your Church,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}come and visit this vine which your own right hand has planted.

\medskip Be mindful, Lord, of all the sons of Abraham,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}fulfill the promises you made to their fathers.

\medskip Merciful God, look kindly upon men and women of every race,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}may they honor you for your goodness.

\medskip Eternal Shepherd, visit the sheep of your flock,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}and gather them together into one fold.

\medskip Remember those who have gone forth from this world in your peace,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}lead them into glory with your Son.
