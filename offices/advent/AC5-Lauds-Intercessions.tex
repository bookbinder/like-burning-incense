Christ is the wisdom and power of God, and his delight is to be with the children of men. With confidence let us pray:\\
\emph{Draw near to us, Lord.}

\medskip Lord Jesus Christ, you have called us to your glorious kingdom,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}make us walk worthily, pleasing God in all we do.

\medskip You who stand unknown among us,

â€” reveal yourself to men and women.

\medskip You are nearer to us than we to ourselves,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}strengthen our faith and our hope of salvation.

\medskip You are the source of holiness,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}keep us holy and without sin now and until the day of your coming.
