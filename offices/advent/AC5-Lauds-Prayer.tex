Lord,\\
our sins bring us unhappiness.\\
Hear our prayer for courage and strength.\\
May the coming of your Son\\
bring us the joy of salvation.\\

Unworthy servants that we are, O Lord,\\
grieved by the guilt of our deeds,\\

by the saving advent of your Only Begotten Son.\\
Who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.
