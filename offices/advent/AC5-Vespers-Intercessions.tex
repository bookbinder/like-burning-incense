To Christ, the great light promised by the prophets to those who live in the shadow of death, let us raise our voices in prayer:\\
\emph{Come, Lord Jesus.}

\medskip Word of God, in the beginning you created all things and in the fullness of time assumed our nature,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}come and deliver us from death.

\medskip True light, shining on mankind,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}come and dispel our darkness.

\medskip Only-begotten Son, dwelling in the Father’s heart,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}come and tell us of God’s loving kindness.

\medskip Christ Jesus, you come among us as the Son of Man,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}transform those who know you into the sons of God.

\medskip You welcome all who call upon you in need,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}bring into your wedding feast those who beg at the door.
