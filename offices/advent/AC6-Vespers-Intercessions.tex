With confidence let us call upon Christ, the shepherd and guardian of our souls:\\
\emph{Lord, have mercy on us.}

\medskip Good shepherd of Godâ€™s flock,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}gather all into your Church.

\medskip Lord Jesus, help the shepherds of your pilgrim people,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}until you come again may they zealously feed your flock.

\medskip Choose from among us heralds of your word,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}to proclaim your Gospel to the ends of the earth.

\medskip Take pity on all who struggle and fall along the way,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}may they find a friend to help them.

\medskip Show your glory in heaven,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}to those who listen to your voice on earth.
