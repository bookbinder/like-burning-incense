Father,\\
creator and redeemer of mankind,\\
you decreed, and your Word became man,\\
born of the Virgin Mary.\\
May we come to share the divinity of Christ,\\
who humbled himself to share our human nature,\\
for he lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.

\begin{prayerverse}
O God, Creator and Redeemer of human nature,\\
who willed that your Word should take flesh\\
in an ever-virgin womb,\\
look with favor on our prayers,\\
that your only Begotten Son,\\
having taken to himself our humanity,\\
may be pleased to grant us a share in his divinity.\\
Who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.
