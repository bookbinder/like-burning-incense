Jesus Christ is the joy and happiness of all who look forward to his coming. Let us call upon him and say:\\
\emph{Come, Lord, and do not delay!}

\medskip In joy, we wait for your coming,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}come, Lord Jesus.

\medskip Before time began, you shared life with the Father,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}come now and save us.

\medskip You created the world and all who live in it,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}come to redeem the work of your hands.

\medskip You did not hesitate to become man, subject to death,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}come to free us from the power of death.

\medskip You came to give us life to the full,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}come and give us your unending life.

\medskip You desire all people to live in love in your kingdom,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}come and bring together those who long to see you face to face.

\medskip
