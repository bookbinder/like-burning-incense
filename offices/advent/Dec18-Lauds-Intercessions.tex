To the Lord Jesus Christ, judge of the living and the dead, let us pray:\\
\emph{Come, Lord Jesus!}

\medskip Lord Jesus, you came to save sinners,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}protect us in times of temptation.

\medskip You will come in glory to be our judge,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}show in us your power to save.

\medskip Help us to keep the precepts of your law with the strength of the Spirit,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}and to look forward in love to your coming.

\medskip You are praised throughout the ages; in your mercy help us to love devoutly and temperately in this life,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}as we wait in joyful hope for the revelation of your glory.

\medskip
