To Christ the Lord, who was born of the Virgin Mary, let us pray with joyful hearts:\\
\emph{Come, Lord Jesus!}

\medskip Lord Jesus, in the mystery of your incarnation you revealed your glory to the world,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}give us new life by your coming.

\medskip You have taken our weakness upon yourself,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}grant us your mercy.

\medskip You redeemed the world from sin by your first coming in humility,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}free us from all guilt when you come again in glory.

\medskip You live and rule over all,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}in your goodness bring us to our eternal inheritance.

\medskip You sit at the right hand of the Father,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}gladden the souls of the dead with your light.

\medskip
