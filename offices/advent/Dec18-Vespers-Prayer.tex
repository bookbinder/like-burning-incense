All-powerful God,\\
renew us by the coming feast of your Son\\

\begin{verse}
Grant, we pray, almighty God,\\
that we, who are weighed down from of old\\
by slavery beneath the yoke of sin,\\
may be set free by the newness\\
of the long-awaited Nativity\\
of your Only Begotten Son.\\
Who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.
