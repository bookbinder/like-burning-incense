To Christ our Redeemer, who will come again to free from the power of death all those who return to him, let us humbly pray:\\
\emph{Come, Lord Jesus!}

\medskip As we proclaim your coming, Lord,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}cleanse our hearts of every vain desire.

\medskip Lord, may the Church which you founded,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}proclaim your greatness to all peoples.

\medskip Your law is a light to our eyes,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}let it protect those who trust in you.

\medskip You allow the joys of your coming to be foretold to us by your Church,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}may we receive you with eager devotion.

\medskip
