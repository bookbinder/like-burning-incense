\settowidth{\versewidth}{to give to saints their glorious crowns}

\begin{hymnverse}[\versewidth]
With mighty voice the prophets cry\\
that Christ the Lord is drawing near;\\
rejoicing, they foresee the grace\\
by which he saves us and redeems.

And so our morning sun shines forth,\\
our hearts ablaze with radiant joy;\\
we hear the faithful voice resound,\\
precursor of God’s glorious gift.

At that first Advent Christ our God\\
came forth not to condemn the world,\\
but came to cleanse our gaping wound,\\
to seek and save what had been lost.

Christ’s Second Coming warns us all\\
that he is standing at the gates\\
to give to saints their glorious crowns\\
and open wide the heav’nly realm.

Eternal light is now foretold,\\
the saving star is shining forth,\\
its radiant splendor summons us\\
and calls us to the heav’nly court.

Christ Jesus, you alone we seek\\
to see you face to face as God;\\
may this unending vision be\\
an everlasting hymn of praise. Amen.
