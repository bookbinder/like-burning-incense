\begin{verse}
God of love and mercy,\\
help us to follow the example of Mary,\\
always ready to do your will.\\
At the message of an angel\\
she welcomed your eternal Son\\
and, filled with the light of your Spirit,\\
she became the temple of your Word,\\
who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.

\begin{verse}
O God, eternal majesty, whose ineffable Word\\
the immaculate Virgin received through the message of an Angel\\
and so became the dwelling-place of divinity,\\
filled with the light of the Holy Spirit,\\
grant, we pray, that by her example\\
we may in humility hold fast to your will.\\
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\\
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.

\end{verse}
