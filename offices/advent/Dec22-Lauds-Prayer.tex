\begin{prayerverse}
God our Father,\\
you sent your Son\\
to free us from the power of death.\\
May we who celebrate the coming of Christ in the flesh\\
share more fully in his divine life,\\
for he lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.

\begin{prayerverse}
O God, who seeing the human race fallen into death,\\
willed to redeem it by the coming of your Only Begotten Son,\\
grant, we pray,\\
that those who confess his Incarnation with humble fervor\\
may merit his company as their Redeemer.\\
Who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.
