Father,\\
we contemplate the birth of your Son.\\
He was born of the Virgin Mary\\
and came to live among us.\\
May we receive forgiveness and mercy.\\
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, \\
who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, \\
God, for ever and ever.\\

\begin{prayerverse}
Almighty ever-living God,\\
as we see how the Nativity of your Son\\
according to the flesh draws near,\\
we pray that to us, your unworthy servants,\\
mercy may flow from your Word,\\
who chose to become flesh of the Virgin Mary\\
and establish among us his dwelling,\\
Jesus Christ our Lord.\\
Who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.
