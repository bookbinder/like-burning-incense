\reading{Isaiah 11:1--3a}

\lettrine{A}{} shoot shall sprout from the stump of Jesse,\\
   and from his roots a bud shall blossom.\\
The spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him:\\
   a spirit of wisdom and of understanding,\\
A spirit of counsel and of strength,\\
   a spirit of knowledge and of fear of the Lord,\\
   and his delight shall be the fear of the Lord.
