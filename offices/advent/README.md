# Note

Note that 'E' or 'F' in the file name stands for the period of time from Dec 17 to Dec 23. These have dedicated antiphons, but the psalms come from either week 3 or week 4, depending on when Advent began. So 'E' will be the period from the 17th to the 23rd, assuming we are in week 3, and 'F' will be the same period assuming we are in week 4.
