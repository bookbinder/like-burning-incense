% Will need these variables to build the cantor and organ scores:
keysig =  \key cis \minor 
antiphon = "3"
psalmtone = "45"
psalmtonestruct = "42"
psalmnum = "Rev_4_11_and_5_9,_10,_12"
% transposition interval for  the corresponding psalm tone
	% to match the key signature of this antiphon. For
	% use in cantor (antiphon) and organ (psalm) scores:
frompitch = a
topitch = a
