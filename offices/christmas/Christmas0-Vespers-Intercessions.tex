Christ Jesus emptied himself and took the form of a slave. He was tested like us in all things and did not sin. Now let us worship him and pray to him with deep faith:\\
\emph{By the power of your birth, comfort those who are saved.}

\medskip You came into the world heralding the new age foretold by the prophets,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}give your holy people the gift of renewal in every generation.

\medskip You once took on the weakness of our human condition,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}be light now for those who do not see, strength for the wavering and comfort for the troubled heart.

\medskip You were born into poverty and lowliness,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}look with favor on the poor and comfort them.

\medskip By your birth bring joy to all peoples with the promise of unending life,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}give joy to the dying through the hope of heavenly birth.

\medskip You came to earth to lead everyone into the Kingdom,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}share your life of glory with those who have died.
