God our Father,\\
every year we rejoice\\
as we look forward to this feast of our salvation.\\
May we welcome Christ as our Redeemer,\\
and meet him with confidence when he comes to be our judge,\\
who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\

\begin{prayerverse}

O God, who gladden us year by year\\
as we wait in hope for our redemption,\\
grant that, just as we joyfully welcome\\
your Only Begotten Son as our Redeemer,\\
we may also merit to face him confidently\\
when he comes again as our Judge.\\
Who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.
