\begin{hymnverse}%%[\versewidth]
From lands beneath the rising sun,\\
through all the compass of the earth,\\
now let us sing to Christ the Lord,\\
the Virgin Mary’s newborn Son.

The hallowed Author of the world\\
a servant’s body has assumed,\\
that liberating flesh by flesh\\
he should not lose what he has made.

Pure grace from heaven entered then\\
the Mother’s womb, both sealed and closed;\\
the cloister of this maiden bride\\
bore secrets she could not have known.

The home of this pure heart became,\\
with sudden pow’r, the shrine of God;\\
a virgin still, she knew not man\\
and by a word conceived her Son.

She brought to birth her holy child,\\
whose advent Gabriel proclaimed,\\
whose presence John perceived with joy\\
and leapt within his mother’s womb.

He lay on straw with no complaint,\\
not shrinking from a manger bed;\\
an infant’s share of milk he drank,\\
while in his care he fed the birds.

The hosts on high exult with joy\\
and angels sing to God with praise;\\
the shepherds wondrously behold\\
the Shepherd, Maker of all things.

To you, Lord Jesus, glory be,\\
the Virgin Mother’s newborn Son,\\
with God the Father, ever blest,\\
and loving Spirit, ever one. Amen.
