The Word of God existed before the creation of the universe yet was born among us in time. We praise and worship him as we cry out in joy:\\
\emph{Let the earth ring out with joy for you have come!}

\medskip You are the eternal Word of God who flooded the world with joy at your birth,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}fill us with joy by the continuous gift of your life.

\medskip You saved us and by your birth revealed to us the covenant faithfulness of the Lord,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}help us to be faithful to the promises of our baptism.

\medskip You are the King of heaven and earth who sent messengers to announce peace to all,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}let our lives be filled with your peace.

\medskip You are the true vine that brings forth the fruit of life,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}make us branches of the vine bearing much fruit.
