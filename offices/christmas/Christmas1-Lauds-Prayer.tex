\begin{prayerverse}

O God, who wonderfully created the dignity of human nature\\
and still more wonderfully restored it,\\
grant, we pray,\\
that we may share in the divinity of Christ,\\
who humbled himself to share in our humanity.\\
Who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.
