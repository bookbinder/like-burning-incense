At the birth of Jesus, angels proclaimed peace to the world. We worship him now with joy, and we pray with hearts full of faith:\\
\emph{May your birth bring peace to all.}

\medskip Lord, fill your holy people with whatever good they need,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}let the mystery of your birth be the source of our peace.

\medskip You came as chief shepherd and guardian of our lives,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}let the pope and bishops be faithful channels of your many gifts of grace.

\medskip King from all eternity, you desired to be born within time and to experience the day-to-day life of men and women,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}share your gift of unending life with us, weak people doomed to death.

\medskip Awaited from the beginning of the world, you came only in the fullness of time,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}now reveal your presence to those who are expecting you.

\medskip You became one of us and gave new life to our human condition in the grip of death,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}now give the fullness of life to all who have died.

\medskip
