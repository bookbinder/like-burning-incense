\reading{1 John 1:1--3}

\lettrine{T}{}his is what we proclaim to you:\\
what was from the beginning,\\
what we have heard,\\
what we have seen with our eyes,\\
what we looked upon\\
and our hands have touchedâ€”\\
we speak of the word of life.\\
(This life became visible;\\
we have seen it and bear witness to it\\
and proclaim to you the eternal life\\
that was with the Father\\
and became visible to us.)\\
What we have seen and heard\\
we proclaim in turn to you\\
so that you may share life with us.\\
This fellowship of ours is with the Father\\
and with his Son, Jesus Christ.
