Dear friends, let us humbly pray to God the Father who so loved us that he sent us his Son:\\
\emph{May the favor of your Son be with us, Lord.}

\medskip God of love, Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, you had mercy on those walking in darkness,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}receive the prayers we offer for the salvation of all people.

\medskip Lord, remember your Church spread over the entire world,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}bless your Christian people and give them peace.

\medskip You are the Father of all people; graciously grant peace to all, direct the eyes of all to your Son,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}and pour forth the spirit of peace on those who rule them.

\medskip You announced peace on earth at the coming of your Son,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}give eternal peace to those who have died.

\medskip
