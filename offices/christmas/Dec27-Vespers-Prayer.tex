\begin{prayerverse}

Father,\\
we are filled with the new light\\
by the coming of your Word among us.\\
May the light of faith\\
shine in our words and actions.\\
We ask this through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\\
who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.
