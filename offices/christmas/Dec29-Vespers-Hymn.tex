\begin{hymnverse}%%[\versewidth]
O blessed Light of saints above\\
and highest Hope of mortal flesh,\\
O Jesus, at your birth is seen\\
the loving smile of fam’ly life.

O Mary, Mother rich in grace,\\
your purest heart alone can love\\
and fondle Jesus on your breast\\
with sweet caresses, nursing him.

O Heir to Patriarchs of old,\\
the Virgin’s chosen guardian blest,\\
with sweetest name, the child divine\\
called you his father here on earth.

From Jesse’s noble lineage sprung\\
to save the nations lost in sin,\\
with kindness hear the humble prayers\\
our hearts pour forth with deep desire.

Your home was like a garden fair,\\
with ev’ry virtue blest by grace.\\
O grant that we may imitate\\
such grace in fam’ly life at home.

Lord Jesus, humbly you became\\
obedient to your parents’ will;\\
to you eternal glory be\\
with Father and with Spirit blest. Amen.
