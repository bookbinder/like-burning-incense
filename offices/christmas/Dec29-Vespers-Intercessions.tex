Let us adore the Son of the living God who humbled himself to become a son of a human family, and let us beseech him:\\
\emph{Lord, you are the model and Savior of all.}

\medskip Christ, by the mystery of your subjection to Mary and Joseph,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}teach all people reverence and obedience to lawful authority.

\medskip You loved your parents and were loved by them,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}establish our families in mutual love and peace.

\medskip You were eager to be about your Father’s business,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}may he be honored in every home.

\medskip Christ, after three days your anxious parents found you in your Father’s house,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}teach all to seek first the kingdom of God.

\medskip Christ, you have made Mary and Joseph sharers in heavenly glory,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}admit the dead into the family of the blessed.
