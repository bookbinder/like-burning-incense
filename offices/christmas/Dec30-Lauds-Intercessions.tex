Let us pray to Christ, in whom the Father willed to make all things new:\\
\emph{Beloved Son of God, hear us.}

\medskip Son of God, you were with the Father in the beginning, and in the fullness of time became a man,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}give us a brotherâ€™s love for all people.

\medskip You became poor to make us rich; you emptied yourself that we might be lifted up by your lowliness and share in your glory,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}make us faithful ministers of your Gospel.

\medskip You shone on those who dwell in darkness and the shadow of death,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}give us holiness, justice and peace.

\medskip  Give us a heart that is upright and sincere, so that we may listen to your word,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}and bring it to perfection in ourselves and in the world for the sake of your glory.

\medskip
