All-powerful God,\\
may the human birth of your Son\\
free us from our former slavery to sin\\
and bring us to new life.\\
We ask this through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\\
who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\

\begin{prayerverse}

Grant, we pray, almighty God,\\
that the newness of the Nativity in the flesh\\
of your Only Begotten Son may set us free,\\
for ancient servitude holds us bound\\
beneath the yoke of sin.\\
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\\
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.
