Let us joyfully acclaim Christ, born at Bethlehem in Judea, for he gives nourishment and guidance to his holy people:\\
\emph{Let your favor rest upon us, Lord.}

\medskip Christ the Savior, desired of the nations, spread your Gospel to places still deprived of the Word of life,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}draw every person to yourself.

\medskip Christ the Lord, let your Church grow and extend the boundaries of its homeland,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}until it embraces men and women of every language and race.

\medskip King of kings, direct the hearts and minds of rulers,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}to seek justice, peace and freedom for all nations.

\medskip Almighty ruler, strength of the weak, support those in temptation, lift up the fallen, protect those living in danger,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}console those who have been deceived, comfort the incurably ill, strengthen the faith of the anxious.

\medskip Consoler of the sorrowful, comfort the dying,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}and lead them to the fountains of living water.
