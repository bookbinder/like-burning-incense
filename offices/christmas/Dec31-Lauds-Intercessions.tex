Humbly yet confidently, let us invoke Christ the Lord whose favor has been shown to all people:\\
\emph{Lord, have mercy.}

\medskip Christ, born of the Father before the ages, splendor of his glory, image of his being, your word holds all creation in being,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}we ask you to give new life to our world through your Gospel.

\medskip Christ, you were born into the world at the fullness of time to save us and to give freedom to every creature,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}we ask you to extend the liberty of our relationship with you to all people.

\medskip Christ, consubstantial Son of the Father, begotten before the dawn of day, and born in Bethlehem in fulfillment of the scriptures,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}we ask you to make your Church a notable example of poverty and simplicity.

\medskip Christ, God and man, Lord of David and Son of David, fulfillment of all prophecies,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}we pray that Israel may recognize you as its Messiah.
