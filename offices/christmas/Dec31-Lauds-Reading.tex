\reading{Isaiah 4:2--3}

\lettrine{O}{n} that day,\\
The branch of the Lord will be luster and glory,\\
   and the fruit of the earth will be honor and splendor\\
   for the survivors of Israel.\\
He who remains in Zion\\
   and he that is left in Jerusalem\\
Will be called holy:\\
   every one marked down for life in Jerusalem.
