\begin{hymnverse}%%[\versewidth]
Why, wicked Herod, should you fear\\
with hostile dread the Christ who comes?\\
He gives us heaven, his own realm,\\
and lays no claim to earthly rule.

The Magi came, led by a star\\
sent forth by God to show the way.\\
By light they sought their way to Light;\\
with incense they confessed him God.

The Lamb of God came forth and touched\\
the River Jordan’s cleansing stream;\\
to wash us clean he took away\\
the sins for which he bore no guilt.

At Cana, power fresh and new\\
once made the jars of water blush;\\
by his command new wine was poured,\\
transformed from water at its source.

To you, Lord Jesus, glory be,\\
revealed to nations on this day,\\
with God the Father, ever blest,\\
and loving Spirit, ever one. Amen.
