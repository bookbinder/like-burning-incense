Let us rejoice in the compassion of Christ, who came to free mankind from the slavery of corruption and to give us the freedom of the sons of God. Trusting in this divine compassion, we plead:\\
\emph{By your birth, deliver us from evil.}

\medskip Lord, you existed before the ages, yet you entered into a new life,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}renew us continually through the mystery of your birth.

\medskip Without surrendering your divinity, you wondrously took on our humanity,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}grant that our lives may press on to a fuller participation in your divinity.

\medskip You came to be a light to the nations, the teacher of holiness,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}let your words be a light along our way.

\medskip Word of God made flesh in the womb of the Virgin Mary, you entered this world,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}live in our hearts always through faith.

\medskip
