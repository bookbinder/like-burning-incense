United with all Christians in prayer and praise, we entreat the Lord:\\
\emph{Father, hear your children.}

\medskip Help those who know not God but seek your presence in the shadows and projections of the human mind,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}make them new persons in the light of Christ.

\medskip Look with favor on all who adore you as the one true God and who await your coming in judgment on the last day,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}may they recognize your constant love for us.

\medskip Remember all those on whom you bestow life, light and all good things,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}let them never be far from you.

\medskip Watch over all travelers with angelic protection,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}and keep them from sudden and unforeseen death.

\medskip You revealed your truth to the dead while they were on earth,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}lead them to contemplate the beauty of your countenance.

\medskip
