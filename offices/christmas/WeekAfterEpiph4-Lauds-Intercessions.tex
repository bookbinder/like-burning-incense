In the fullness of time, the eternal Word was begotten of the Father. He is the child who is born for us, the son who is given to us. To him we lift our voices in joy:\\
\emph{Praise be to you, Lord.}

\medskip Son of the living God, you existed before the world was made and you came on earth to save all,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}enable us to be witnesses to your Gospel.

\medskip Sun of Justice, whose brightness shone forth from the bosom of the Father and flooded the entire world,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}be light for all who dwell in darkness and the shadow of death.

\medskip You became a little child and lay in a manger,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}renew in us the simplicity of little children.

\medskip For our sake you became the living bread of eternal life,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}fill us with joy through the sacrament of your altar.

\medskip
