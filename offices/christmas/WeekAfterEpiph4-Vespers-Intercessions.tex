Let us praise the Word of God, for he has come to cast our sins into the sea. Strengthened by this knowledge, let us pray to him:\\
\emph{Lord, show us your compassion.}

\medskip As eternal high priest you entered the world and established the fullest expression of worship,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}through your Church let all men and women share in this sacred liturgy.

\medskip As physician of bodies and spirits you came to visit all who were sick,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}heal and strengthen those who are ill.

\medskip You were a source of joy for all at your birth,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}give hope to those in torment and to those in sin that they may be able to rejoice in you.

\medskip Mighty King, you cut the bonds of our former slavery,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}release those who are captives and show your care for those in prison.

\medskip You came as the door leading into heaven,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}let the dead pass through that door into the heavenly kingdom.
