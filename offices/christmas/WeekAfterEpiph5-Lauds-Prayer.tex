God our Father,\\
through Christ your Son\\
the hope of eternal life dawned on our world.\\

O God, who through your Son raised up your eternal light for all nations,\\
grant that your people may come to acknowledge\\

Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\\
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\\
