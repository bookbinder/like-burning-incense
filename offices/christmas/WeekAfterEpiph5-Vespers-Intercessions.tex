United in prayer with all of our brothers and sisters, we bless God and invoke his name:\\
\emph{Lord, show us your compassion.}

\medskip Holy Father, we pray for those who know you only by the light of human reason,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}may they be enriched by the light of the Gospel as well.

\medskip Look with favor on all who live outside the Church as they seek liberation from the harsh constraints of human existence,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}may they discover Christ as the way, the truth and the life.

\medskip Help all who practice their faith in sincerity,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}may they attain to the marvelous light of your anointed one.

\medskip Keep pure the hearts of believers,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}may they see you more clearly at every moment.

\medskip Let your compassion be visible to those who have died,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}clothe them in the glory of your chosen people.

\medskip
