\begin{hangpar}

Give honor and glory to Jesus Christ who comes to create a new heart and a new spirit in all. We call on him as we say:\\
\emph{By the power of your birth, make us new persons.}

\medskip You took on our life and offered us in return the mystery of Godâ€™s life,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}help us to recognize you in the mysteries of your word and your eucharist which you entrusted to your Church.

\medskip Founder of the human race, through the spotless Virgin you became one of us,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}through her intercession, may we touch your divinity and be healed.

\medskip Our Redeemer, you descended upon the earth as the rain which fell upon the sheepskin of Gideon,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}now drench our lives in the living water that springs up to provide eternal life.

\medskip As we celebrate the beginning of your life on this earth,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}let us imitate that perfect manhood which you revealed in your life among us.
