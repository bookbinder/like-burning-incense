We pray now to the Father who has appointed Christ a light to the nations:\\
\emph{Father, hear our prayer.}

\medskip Give increase to your Church,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}and spread the glory of your Son.

\medskip Eternal Father, you led the wise men from the East to your Son,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}reveal him to all who seek the truth.

\medskip Draw all nations into your marvelous light,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}so that at the name of Jesus every knee will bend.

\medskip Send laborers into your vineyard,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}let them preach the Gospel to the poor and announce a time of grace.

\medskip Grant the dead the fullness of redemption,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}that they may rejoice in the victory of Christ, your Son.
