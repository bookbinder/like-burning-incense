Let us give glory to Christ, the image of God, as we call upon him in faith:\\
\emph{Christ, Son of God, hear us.}

\medskip Son of God, you showed us the Father’s love,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}reveal him to men and women through the love we show toward one another.

\medskip You revealed yourself as Lord of life,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}now grant us the fullness of your life.

\medskip Let our bodies be signs of your life,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}as we bear your dying in our flesh.

\medskip Illuminate our hearts,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}with the brilliant knowledge of God’s light.

\medskip
