\begin{prayerverse}

God our Father,\\
through your Son you made us a new creation.\\
He shared our nature and became one of us;\\
with his help, may we become more like him,\\
who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.

\begin{prayerverse}

Almighty ever-living God,\\
who were pleased to shine forth with new light\\
through the coming of your Only Begotten Son,\\
grant, we pray,\\
that, just as he was pleased to share our bodily form\\
through the childbearing of the Virgin Mary,\\
so we, too, may one day merit\\
to become companions in his kingdom of grace.\\
Who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.
