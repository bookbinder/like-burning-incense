\reading{Wisdom 7:26--27}

\lettrine{W}{}isdom is the refulgence of eternal light,\\
   the spotless mirror of the power of God,\\
   the image of his goodness.\\
And she, who is one, can do all things,\\
   and renews everything while herself perduring;\\
And passing into holy souls from age to age,\\
   she produces friends of God and prophets.
