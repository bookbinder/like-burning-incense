Let us direct our prayers to Christ, the heavenly man and the new Adam, who became a life-giving spirit:\\
\emph{Be with us, Emmanuel.}

\medskip Christ, Sun of Justice, you revealed your glory in our human nature in order to bring to perfection the old covenant,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}we ask you to pour out your light upon us.

\medskip Christ, you were glorified by the angels, announced by the shepherds, confessed and proclaimed by Simeon and Anna,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}let your Gospel be accepted by the people of the promise.

\medskip Christ, when you were born, angels sang glory to God in the highest and peace on earth,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}we ask you to spread your peace throughout the world.

\medskip Christ, as the new Adam you gave new life to the old man, and prepared for us a dwelling place in your kingdom,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}may those overwhelmed by evil be encouraged by hope in you.
