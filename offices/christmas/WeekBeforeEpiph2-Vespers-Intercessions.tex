  prophets and last of all he spoke to us through his Son.\\
  Let us invoke his compassion:\\

\emph{Kyrie, eleison.}

\medskip For those spreading the good news of salvation,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}that the workers sent by you may preach the name of the Savior with full confidence:
\emph{Kyrie, eleison.}

\medskip For our sick brothers and sisters,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}that they may regain their health by calling upon the name of the Savior:
\emph{Kyrie, eleison.}

\medskip For Christians subject to persecution,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}that they may endure the injustice done them for the name of the Savior:
\emph{Kyrie, eleison.}

\medskip For our brothers and sisters who have died through the sin of man,

\emph{Kyrie, eleison.}
