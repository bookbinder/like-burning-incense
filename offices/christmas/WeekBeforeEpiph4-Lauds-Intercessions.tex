\intercessions\indent

\begin{hangpar}

Let us glorify the Word of God who was revealed in the flesh, appeared to the angels, and was proclaimed to the nations. Let us faithfully acknowledge him:
\emph{We adore you, only-begotten Son of the Father.}

\medskip Liberator of mankind, through the Virgin Mary you came to renew us.

{\color{red}---\thinspace}through her intercession keep us from our old ways.

\medskip You made your uncreated justice radiate from heaven to earth,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}direct our days and our nights in the brightness of this Sun.

\medskip Son of God, you have shown us the Father's love,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}help us to show him to one another by our love.

\medskip You chose to dwell with us,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}make us worthy of your companionship.
