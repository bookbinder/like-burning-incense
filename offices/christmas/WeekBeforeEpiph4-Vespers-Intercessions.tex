Christ came and gave himself up to purify his people, to make of them an acceptable offering, a band of disciples to continue his good work. With fervent devotion let us call upon him:\\
\emph{Lord, have mercy.}

\medskip For your holy Church.

{\color{red}---\thinspace }that all her children may be born again into a new life:\\
\emph{Lord, have mercy.}

\medskip For the poor, for prisoners and for refugees,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}may they find you, the incarnate Son of God, in our love:\\
\emph{Lord, have mercy.}

\medskip That our joy may be full,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}and that we may marvel at the Father's gift, which he has given us in you:\\
\emph{Lord, have mercy.}

\medskip That your servants who have died with the knowledge of your birth may see your face,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}and that night may fall upon them no more:\\
\emph{Lord, have mercy.}

\medskip
