Christ embodied the wisdom of God, his justice, his holiness and his saving power. Let us praise him and call upon him confidently:\\
\emph{Lord, save us by your birth.}

\medskip King of the world, the shepherds found you wrapped in swaddling clothes,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}make us willing participants in your poverty and simplicity.

\medskip Lord of heaven, from your royal throne you came down to the world,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}teach us to respect our less fortunate brothers and sisters.

\medskip Christ, light eternal, when you assumed our nature you did not take on its stain,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}help your faithful people to use the good things of the earth for your honor and glory.

\medskip You are the divine spouse of your Church; you stand in its midst as an impregnable tower,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}help the faithful to persevere in your Church toward salvation.
