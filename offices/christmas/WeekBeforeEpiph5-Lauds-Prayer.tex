\prayer

\begin{prayerverse}
God our Father,\\
when your Son was born of the Virgin Mary\\
he became like us in all things but sin.\\
May we who have been reborn in him\\
be free from our sinful ways.\\
We ask this through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\\
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.

\end{prayerverse}
