To Christ, Emmanuel, whom the Virgin conceived and brought forth, let us give praise and pray to him:\\
\emph{Son of the Virgin Mary, hear us.}

\medskip You gave Mary the joy of motherhood,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}give all parents true joy in their children.

\medskip You made yourself a child.

{\color{red}---\thinspace}grant children wisdom and grace.

\medskip You came to make the human race the holy people of God,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}bring all nations to acknowledge the unifying bond of your love.

\medskip By your birth you strengthened family ties,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}help families to come to a greater love for one another. 

\medskip You desired to be born into the days of time,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}grant that our departed brothers and sisters may be born into the day of eternity.

\medskip
