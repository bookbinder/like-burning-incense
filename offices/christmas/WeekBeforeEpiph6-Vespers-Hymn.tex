\begin{hymnverse}%%[\versewidth]
O Christ, Redeemer of us all,\\
the Father’s Sole-begotten Son,\\
in myst’ry born alone from him,\\
so wondrously before all time,

The Father’s splendor and true Light,\\
O everlasting hope for all,\\
bend low to hear your servants’ prayers\\
poured forth to you throughout the earth.

O author of all saving grace,\\
recall that once you took our flesh\\
and from the Virgin pure and chaste\\
assumed by birth our human form.

This feast today now testifies,\\
within the cycle of the year,\\
that you as Savior of the world\\
alone came from the Father’s throne.

The sky above, the earth, the sea,\\
and all creation held therein\\
extol with joyous hymns of praise\\
the Author of your advent here.

We also, whom you came to save\\
and by your holy blood redeem,\\
all sing a new and joyful hymn\\
to celebrate your day of birth.

To you, Lord Jesus, glory be,\\
the Virgin Mother’s newborn Son,\\
with God the Father, ever blest,\\
and Loving Spirit, ever one. Amen.
