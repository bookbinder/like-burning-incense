At the coming of Christ, Godâ€™s holy people were made sharers in new life. With joy and gratitude let us say to our Savior:\\
\emph{May your birth bring joy to the world.}

\medskip Christ, our life, you came to be the head of your Church,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}grant your body growth rooted in charity.

\medskip Fully human, fully divine, you deserve our adoration,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}mold our humanity in your divine image.

\medskip You became our mediator through your incarnation,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}unite your servants in the Church more closely to your work through the holiness of their lives.

\medskip When you came you inaugurated a new era,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}lead all nations to your salvation.

\medskip By your birth you destroyed the chains of death,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}free the dead from all their chains.
