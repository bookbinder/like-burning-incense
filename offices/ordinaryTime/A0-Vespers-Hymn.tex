\begin{hymnverse}
O God, Creator of the world\\
and Ruler of the sky above,\\
you clothe the day with splendid light\\
and night with gracious gifts of sleep,

That limbs relaxed by quiet rest\\
may be restored to use and toil,\\
that weary minds may be refreshed\\
and anxious sorrows be relieved.

As day now changes into night\\
we pay our debt of grateful prayer;\\
sustain and help those bound to you\\
as we pour forth our hymn of praise.

May hearts unite from deep within\\
to honor you with ringing praise,\\
to cherish you with purest love,\\
to worship you with sober mind,

That as the deep’ning gloom of night\\
shuts out the light and bars the day,\\
no darkness may obscure our faith\\
and night by faith may fill with light.

We ask the Father and the Son\\
and beg the Spirit of them both:\\
Sustain us with your loving care,\\
who reign forever Three in One. Amen.
\end{hymnverse}
