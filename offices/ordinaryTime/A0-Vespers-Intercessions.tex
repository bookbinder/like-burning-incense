We give glory to the one God—Father, Son and Holy Spirit—and in our weakness we pray:\\
\emph{Lord, be with your people.}

\medskip Holy Lord, Father all-powerful, let justice spring up on the earth,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}then your people will dwell in the beauty of peace.

\medskip Let every nation come into your kingdom,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}so that all peoples will be saved.

\medskip Let married couples live in your peace,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}and grow in mutual love.

\medskip Reward all who have done good to us, Lord,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}and grant them eternal life.

\medskip Look with compassion on victims of hatred and war,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}grant them heavenly peace.
