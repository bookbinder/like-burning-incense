\psalmsubtitle{Eternal Maker of the World}

\begin{hymnverse}
Eternal Author of the world,\\
who rule and order night and day,\\
you measure seasons by the hours\\
to lift our weary minds and hearts.

The herald of the day now cries,\\
all watchful through the darkest hours;\\
nocturnal light for those who roam,\\
he marks the watches of the night.

He crows: the morning star awakes\\
and rids the skies of night and gloom;\\
he crows: all roving errant bands\\
forsake their paths of vice and harm.

He crows: the sailor gathers strength,\\
and storms on foaming seas grow calm;\\
he crows: the Church’s rock himself\\
by bitter tears dissolves his sin.

O Jesus, heed us as we fall,\\
correct us by your loving gaze,\\
for if you look, transgressions fail\\
and tears release us from our guilt.

Shine forth your light upon our hearts,\\
shake off the slumber from our souls,\\
and let our voice first sound your praise\\
as we fulfill our vows to you.

O Christ, to you, most loving King,\\
and to the Father glory be,\\
one with the Spirit Paraclete,\\
from age to age for evermore. Amen.
