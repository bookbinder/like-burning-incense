Christ is the sun that never sets, the true light that shines on every man. Let us call out to him in praise:\\
\emph{Lord, you are our life and our salvation.}

\medskip
Creator of the stars, we thank you for your gift, the first rays of the dawn,\\
{\color{red}---}and we commemorate your resurrection.

\medskip
May your Holy Spirit teach us to do your will today,\\
{\color{red}---}and may your wisdom guide us always.

\medskip
Each Sunday give us the joy of gathering as your people,\\
{\color{red}---}around the table of your Word and your Body.

\medskip
From our hearts we thank you,\\
{\color{red}---}for your countless blessings.
