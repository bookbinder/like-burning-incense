\begin{verse}
Sublime Creator of the light,\\
in bringing forth the light of day,\\
from fountains of that pristine light\\
you form the fabric of the world.

The morning joined to evening hour\\
is named the day at your command;\\
as formless dark steals over us,\\
in mercy heed our prayers and tears.

Let not our soul, weighed down by faults,\\
be exiled from the gift of life\\
and, heedless of eternal good,\\
ensnare itself in bonds of guilt.

But let it knock at heaven’s gate\\
to gain the prize of lasting life;\\
let us avoid all harm from sin\\
and purge away all base desire.

Most loving Father, hear our prayer,\\
and you, O Christ coequal Son,\\
who with the Spirit Paraclete\\
now reign for all eternity. Amen.
\end{verse}
