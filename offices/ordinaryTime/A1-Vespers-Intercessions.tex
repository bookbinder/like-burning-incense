Christ the Lord is our head; we are his members. In joy let us call out to him:\\
\emph{Lord, may your kingdom come.}

\medskip Christ our Savior, make your Church a more vivid symbol of the unity of all mankind,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}make it more effectively the sacrament of salvation for all peoples.

\medskip Through your presence, guide the college of bishops in union with the Pope,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}give them the gifts of unity, love and peace.

\medskip Bind all Christians more closely to yourself, their divine Head,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}lead them to proclaim your kingdom by the witness of their lives.

\medskip Grant peace to the world,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}let every land flourish in justice and security.

\medskip Grant to the dead the glory of resurrection,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}and give us a share in their happiness.
