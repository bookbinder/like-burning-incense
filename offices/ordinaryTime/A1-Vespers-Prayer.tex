\begin{prayerverse}
Free us from darkness\\
and keep us in the radiance of your truth.\\
We ask this through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\\
who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.

{\color{red}Or:}

O God, who through the grace of adoption\\
chose us to be children of light,\\
grant, we pray,\\
that we may not be wrapped in the darkness of error\\
but always be seen to stand in the bright light of truth.\\
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\\
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.
