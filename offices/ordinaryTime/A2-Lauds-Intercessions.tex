\begin{hangpar}

We esteem Christ above all men, for he was filled with grace and the Holy Spirit. In faith let us implore him:\\
\emph{Give us your Spirit, Lord.}

\medskip Grant us a peaceful day,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}when evening comes we will praise you with joy and purity of heart.

\medskip Let your splendor rest upon us today,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}direct the work of our hands.

\medskip May your face shine upon us and keep us in peace,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}may your strong arm protect us.

\medskip Look kindly on all who put their trust in our prayers,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}fill them with every bodily and spiritual grace.
