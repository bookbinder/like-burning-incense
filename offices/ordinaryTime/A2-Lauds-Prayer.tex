\begin{verse}
Father,\\
may everything we do\\
begin with your inspiration\\
and continue with your saving help.\\
Let our work always find its origin in you\\
and through you reach completion.\\
We ask this through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\\
who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.
