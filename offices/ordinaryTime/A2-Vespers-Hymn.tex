\hymn

\begin{verse}
O wondrous Maker of the sky,\\
dividing waters, stream from stream,\\
you stem their tide with heaven’s dome,\\
to curb the mixed, chaotic flow.

You fix a place for sun and stars\\
and trace the paths for streams on earth,\\
that waters temper scorching rays\\
and so preserve the fertile land.

Pour forth on us, Most Holy One,\\
the gift of everlasting grace,\\
lest by a stroke of fresh deceit\\
the ancient sin should wear us down.

Let faith search out and find the light\\
and such a beam of light bring forth,\\
that all vain idols flee in dread\\
and falsehood never cloud its ray.

Most loving Father, hear our prayer,\\
and you, O Christ coequal Son,\\
who with the Spirit Paraclete\\
now reign for all eternity. Amen.
\end{verse}
