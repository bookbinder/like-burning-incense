God has made an everlasting covenant with his people, and he never ceases to bless them. Grateful for these gifts, we confidently direct our prayer to him:\\
\emph{Lord, bless your people.}

\medskip Save your people, Lord,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}and bless your inheritance.

\medskip Gather into one body all who bear the name of Christian,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}that the world may believe in Christ whom you have sent.

\medskip Give our friends and our loved ones a share in divine life,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}let them be symbols of Christ before men.

\medskip Show your love to those who are suffering,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}open their eyes to the vision of your revelation.

\medskip Be compassionate to those who have died,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}welcome them into the company of the faithful departed.
