\begin{verse}
Father,\\
may this evening pledge of our service to you\\
bring you glory and praise.\\
For our salvation you looked with favor,\\
on the lowliness of the Virgin Mary;\\
lead us to the fullness of the salvation\\
you have prepared for us.\\
We ask this through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\\
who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.
\end{verse}
