Beloved brothers and sisters, we share a heavenly calling under Christ, our high priest. Let us praise him with shouts of joy:\\
\emph{Lord, our God and our Savior.}

Almighty King, through baptism you conferred on us a royal priesthood,\\
{\color{red}---}inspire us to offer you a continual sacrifice of praise.

\medskip
Help us to keep your commandments,\\
{\color{red}---}that through the power of the Holy Spirit we may live in you and you in us.

\medskip
Give us your eternal wisdom,\\
{\color{red}---}to be with us today and to guide us.

\medskip
May our companions today be free of sorrow,\\
{\color{red}---}and filled with joy.
