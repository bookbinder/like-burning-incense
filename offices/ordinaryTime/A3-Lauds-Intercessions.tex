\begin{hangpar}

Beloved brothers and sisters, we share a heavenly calling under Christ, our high priest. Let us praise him with shouts of joy:\\
\emph{Lord, our God and our Savior.}

\medskip Almighty King, through baptism you conferred on us a royal priesthood,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}inspire us to offer you a continual sacrifice of praise.

\medskip Help us to keep your commandments,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}that through the power of the Holy Spirit we may live in you and you in us.

\medskip Give us your eternal wisdom,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}to be with us today and to guide us.

\medskip May our companions today be free of sorrow,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}and filled with joy.
