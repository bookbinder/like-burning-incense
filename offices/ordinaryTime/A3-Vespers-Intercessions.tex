Let us praise Christ the Lord, who lives among us, the people he redeemed, and let us say:\\
\emph{Lord, hear our prayer.}

\medskip Lord, king and ruler of nations, be with all your people and their governments,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}inspire them to pursue the good of all according to your law.

\medskip You made captive our captivity,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}to our brothers who are enduring bodily or spiritual chains, grant the freedom of the sons of God.

\medskip May our young people be concerned with remaining blameless in your sight,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}and may they generously follow your call.

\medskip May our children imitate your example,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}and grow in wisdom and grace.

\medskip Accept our dead brothers and sisters into your eternal kingdom,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}where we hope to reign with you.
