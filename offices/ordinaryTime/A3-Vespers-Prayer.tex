\begin{verse}
Almighty God,\\
we give you thanks\\
for bringing us safely\\
to this evening hour.\\
May this lifting up of our hands in prayer\\
be a sacrifice pleasing in your sight.\\
We ask this through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\\
who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.
\end{verse}
