\reading{1 John 3:1--3}

\lettrine{S}{ee} what love the Father has bestowed on us
in letting us be called the children of God.
Yet that is what we are.
Dearly beloved,
we are Godâ€™s children now;
what we shall later be has not yet come to light.
We know that when it comes to light
we shall be like him,
for we shall see him as he is.
