\hymn

\begin{verse}
O night and darkness, clouded gloom,\\
disturbed confusion of the world,\\
the dawn appears, the sky grows pale;\\
disperse and go, for Christ comes forth.

The veil of darkness, torn apart,\\
is pierced by sharpened rays of sun;\\
now color is restored to earth\\
beneath the daystar’s shining face.

Just so the darkness of our lives\\
and hearts aware of veiled deceit\\
shall pale before the reign of God,\\
laid bare, as clouds are rent by light.

In knowing you alone, O Christ,\\
with pure and honest mind and heart,\\
we learn to pray on bended knee,\\
to come to you with tears and praise.

Look deeply now into our hearts,\\
examine closely our whole life,\\
where much is tainted by deceit:\\
Lord, cleanse and purge it by your light.

O Christ, to you, most loving King,\\
and to the Father glory be,\\
one with the Spirit Paraclete,\\
from age to age for evermore. Amen.
