Let us give thanks to Christ and offer him continual praise, for he sanctifies us and calls us his brothers:\\
\emph{Lord, help your brothers to grow in holiness.}

\medskip
With single-minded devotion we dedicate the beginnings of this day to the honor of your resurrection,\\
{\color{red}---}may we make the whole day pleasing to you by our works of holiness.

\medskip
As a sign of your love, you renew each day for the sake of our well-being and happiness,\\
{\color{red}---}renew us daily for the sake of your glory.

\medskip
Teach us today to recognize your presence in all men,\\
{\color{red}---}especially in the poor and in those who mourn.

\medskip
Grant that we may live today in peace with all men,\\
{\color{red}---}never rendering evil for evil.
