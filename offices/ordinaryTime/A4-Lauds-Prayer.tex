\begin{prayerverse}
God our Savior,\\
hear our morning prayer:\\
help us to follow the light\\
and live the truth.\\
In you we have been born again\\
as sons and daughters of light:\\
may we be your witnesses before all the world.\\
We ask this through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\\
who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.
