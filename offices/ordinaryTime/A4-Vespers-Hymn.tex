\begin{verse}
Most Holy God in heav’n above,\\
who paints the sky with gleaming ray,\\
adorning with resplendent lights\\
the glowing dome of heaven’s vault,

On this fourth day you set in place\\
the flaming circle of the sun\\
and made the wand’ring paths of stars\\
to serve the orbit of the moon,

That you might set for night and day\\
a bound’ry keeping them apart\\
and mark with clear, unfailing sign\\
each new beginning of the month.

Enlighten ev’ry heart and mind\\
and wipe away all shameful thoughts;\\
deliver us from bonds of guilt\\
and ease the burden of our sin.

Most loving Father, hear our prayer,\\
and you, O Christ coequal Son,\\
who with the Spirit Paraclete\\
now reign for all eternity. Amen.
\end{verse}
