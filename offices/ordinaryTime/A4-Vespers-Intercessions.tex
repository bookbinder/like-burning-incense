In all that we do, let the name of the Lord be praised, for he surrounds his chosen people with boundless love. Let our prayer rise up to him:\\
\emph{Lord, show us your love.}

\medskip Remember your Church, Lord,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}keep her from every evil and let her grow to the fullness of your love.

\medskip Let the nations recognize you as the one true God,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}and Jesus your Son, as the Messiah whom you sent.

\medskip Grant prosperity to our neighbors,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}give them life and happiness for ever.

\medskip Console those who are burdened with oppressive work and daily hardships,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}preserve the dignity of workers.

\medskip Open wide the doors of your compassion to those who have died today,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}and in your mercy receive them into your kingdom.
