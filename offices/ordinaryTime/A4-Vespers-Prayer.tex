\begin{verse}
Lord,\\
watch over us by day and by night.\\
In the midst of lifeâ€™s countless changes\\
strengthen us with your never-changing love.\\
We ask this through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\\
who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.
