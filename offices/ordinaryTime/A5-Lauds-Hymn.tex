\hymn

\begin{hymnverse}
Behold the fiery sun arise!\\
It troubles, shames, and brings remorse,\\
for no one can persist in sin\\
when light bears witness to our guilt.

Let blindness disappear at last\\
that long has plunged us deep in sin\\
and so has drawn our fallen souls\\
by errant steps, through wand’ring paths.

Then let this Light bring cloudless day\\
and make us pure before his gaze;\\
let nothing sly be on our tongue\\
and nothing dark be in our thought.

Let all the day so run its course,\\
that no unguarded tongue may lie,\\
no furtive eye or hand deceive,\\
lest sin defile our mortal flesh.

The One who sees stands by on high\\
and watches us through all our days,\\
discerning ev’ry act and deed\\
from early dawn to eventide.

To God the Father glory be,\\
all honor to his only Son,\\
one with the Spirit Paraclete,\\
from age to age for evermore. Amen.
\end{hymnverse}
