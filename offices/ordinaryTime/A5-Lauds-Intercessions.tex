The Lord Jesus Christ has given us the light of another day. In return we thank him as we cry out:\\
\emph{Lord, bless us and bring us close to you.}

\medskip You offered yourself in sacrifice for our sins,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}accept our intentions and our work today.

\medskip You bring us joy by the light of another day,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}let the morning star rise in our hearts.

\medskip Give us strength to be patient with those we meet today,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}and so imitate you.

\medskip Make us aware of your mercy this morning, Lord,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}and let your strength be our delight.
