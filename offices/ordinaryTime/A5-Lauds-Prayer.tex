\begin{verse}
All-powerful and ever-living God,\\
at morning, noon, and evening we pray:\\
cast out from our hearts the darkness of sin\\
and bring us to the light of your truth,\\
Jesus Christ, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.
\end{verse}
