\reading{Isaiah 66:1--2}

\lettrine{T}{hus} says the Lord:
The heavens are my throne,
   and the earth is my footstool.
What kind of house can you build for me;
   what is to be my resting place?
My hand made all these things
   when all of them came to be, says the Lord.
This is the one whom I approve:
   the lowly and afflicted man who trembles at my word.
