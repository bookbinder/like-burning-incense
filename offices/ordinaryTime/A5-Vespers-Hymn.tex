\hymn

\begin{hymnverse}
O God of awesome pow’r and might,\\
you send into the swelling deep\\
or lift on wings from earth to sky\\
your creatures sprung from flowing tides,

That, plunged in waters and submerged\\
or born aloft to heav’nly heights,\\
the offspring of a single stock\\
may grow and fill their proper place.

Lord, grant to all your servants here,\\
whom streams of blood and water cleanse,\\
to know no failing caused by sin\\
or bear the loathsome weight of death,

That sin may never cast them down\\
or boasting swell and lift them high,\\
lest broken souls collapse and fall\\
and prideful souls soon come to grief.

Most loving Father, hear our prayer,\\
and you, O Christ coequal Son,\\
who with the Spirit Paraclete\\
now reign for all eternity. Amen.
\end{hymnverse}
