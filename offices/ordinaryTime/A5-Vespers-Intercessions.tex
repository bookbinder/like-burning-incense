Christ rose from the dead as the first fruits of those who sleep. In our joy let us praise him, and say:\\
\emph{Firstborn from the dead, hear our prayer.}

\medskip Lord Jesus, remember your holy Church, built on the apostles and reaching to the ends of the earth,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}and let your blessing rest on all who believe in you.

\medskip You are the healer of soul and body,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}come to our aid, and save us in your love.

\medskip Raise up the sick and give them strength,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}free them from their infirmities.

\medskip Help those in distress of mind or body,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}and in your compassion lift up those in need.

\medskip Through your cross and resurrection you opened for all the way to immortality,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}grant to our deceased brothers and sisters the joys of your kingdom.
