Our hope is in God, who gives us help. Let us call upon him, and say:\\
\emph{Look kindly on your children, Lord.}

\medskip Lord, our God, you made an eternal covenant with your people,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}keep us ever mindful of your mighty deeds.

\medskip Let your ordained ministers grow toward perfect love,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}and preserve your faithful people in unity by the bond of peace.

\medskip Be with us in our work of building the earthly city,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}that in building we may not labor in vain.

\medskip Send workers into your vineyard,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}and glorify your name among the nations.

\medskip Welcome into the company of your saints our relatives and benefactors who have died,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}may we share their happiness one day.
