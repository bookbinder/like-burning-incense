\prayer


\begin{prayerverse}
Father,\\
you illumine the night\\
and bring the dawn to scatter darkness.\\
Let us pass this night in safety,\\
free from Satanâ€™s power,\\
and rise when morning comes\\
to give you thanks and praise.\\
We ask this through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\\
who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.
\end{prayerverse}
