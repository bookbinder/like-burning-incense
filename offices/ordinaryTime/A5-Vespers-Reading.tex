\reading{1 Peter 3:18, 22}

\lettrine{T}{he} reason why Christ died for sins once for all, the just man for the sake of the unjust, was that he might lead you to God. He was put to death insofar as fleshly existence goes, but was given life in the realm of the spirit. He went to heaven and is at Godâ€™s right hand, with angelic rulers and powers subjected to him.
