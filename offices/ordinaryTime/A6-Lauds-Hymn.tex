\begin{hymnverse}
Eternal glory of the skies,\\
O blessed hope for all on earth,\\
O child of Mary, Virgin pure,\\
and only Son of God most high,

Extend your right hand as we wake\\
and help us rise with sober mind,\\
that ardent in the praise of God,\\
we may repay the thanks we owe.

The gleaming morning star appears\\
as herald of the light itself,\\
and darkness of the night recedes:\\
may holy light shine forth on us.

Let it remain within our mind\\
to drive from us all worldly night,\\
and so, by cleansing hearts of sin,\\
preserve them till the end of time.

Let faith, the gift first sought and found,\\
take root within our inmost heart,\\
and next, let hope rejoice in faith;\\
then love, the greatest gift, abides.

O Christ, to you, most loving King,\\
and to the Father glory be,\\
one with the Spirit Paraclete,\\
from age to age for evermore. Amen.
