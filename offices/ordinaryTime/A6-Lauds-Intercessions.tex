\intercessions

\begin{raggedright}
Through his cross the Lord Jesus brought salvation to the human race. We adore him and in faith we call out to him:\\
\emph{Lord, pour out your mercy upon us.}

\medskip
Christ, Rising Sun, warm us with your rays,\\
{\color{red}---}and restrain us from every evil impulse.

\medskip
Keep guard over our thoughts, words and actions,\\
{\color{red}---}and make us pleasing in your sight this day.

\medskip
Turn your gaze from our sinfulness,\\
{\color{red}---}and cleanse us from our iniquities.

\medskip
Through your cross and resurrection,\\
{\color{red}---}fill us with the consolation of the Spirit.
