Through his cross the Lord Jesus brought salvation to the human race. We adore him and in faith we call out to him:\\
\emph{Lord, pour out your mercy upon us.}

\medskip Christ, Rising Sun, warm us with your rays,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}and restrain us from every evil impulse.

\medskip Keep guard over our thoughts, words and actions,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}and make us pleasing in your sight this day.

\medskip Turn your gaze from our sinfulness,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}and cleanse us from our iniquities.

\medskip Through your cross and resurrection,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}fill us with the consolation of the Spirit.
