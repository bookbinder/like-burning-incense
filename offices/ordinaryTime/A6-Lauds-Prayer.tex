\begin{verse}
God our Father,\\
you conquer the darkness of ignorance\\
by the light of your Word.\\
Strengthen within our hearts\\
the faith you have given us;\\
let not temptation ever quench the fire\\
that your love has kindled within us.\\
We ask this through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\\
who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.
\end{verse}
