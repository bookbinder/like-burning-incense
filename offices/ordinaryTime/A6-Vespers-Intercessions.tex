\begin{hangpar}

Blessed be God, who hears the prayers of the needy, and fills the hungry with good things. Let us pray to him in confidence:\\
\emph{Lord, show us your mercy.}

\medskip Merciful Father, upon the cross Jesus offered you the perfect evening sacrifice,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}we pray now for all the suffering members of his Church.

\medskip Release those in bondage, give sight to the blind,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}shelter the widow and the orphan.

\medskip Clothe your faithful people in the armor of salvation,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}and shield them from the deceptions of the devil.

\medskip Let your merciful presence be with us, Lord, at the hour of our death,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}may we be found faithful and leave this world in your peace.

\medskip Lead the departed into the light of your dwelling-place,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}that they may gaze upon you for all eternity.
