\begin{prayerverse}
God our Father,\\
help us to follow the example\\
of your Sonâ€™s patience in suffering.\\
By sharing the burden he carries,\\
may we come to share his glory\\
in the kingdom where he lives with you and the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.
\end{prayerverse}
