\hymn

\begin{verse}
Now dawn unfolds across the sky\\
and day drifts down upon the earth;\\
a piercing ray rebounds in light:\\
let ev’ry lure of sin depart.

Illusions of the night, be gone.\\
All guilt of mind and heart, now yield.\\
Whatever comes from dreaded fault,\\
brought in by night, now disappear.

So may that great and final dawn,\\
which we await with awe and hope,\\
shine forth on us in splendid light,\\
as morning echoes with this hymn.

To God the Father glory be,\\
all honor to his only Son,\\
one with the Spirit Paraclete,\\
from age to age for evermore. Amen.
\end{verse}
