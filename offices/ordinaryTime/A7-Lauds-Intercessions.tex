\intercessions

\begin{raggedright}
Let us all praise Christ. In order to become our faithful and merciful high priest before the Fatherâ€™s throne, he chose to become one of us, a brother in all things. In prayer we ask of him:\\
\emph{Lord, share with us the treasure of your love.}

\medskip
Sun of Justice, you filled us with light at our baptism,\\
{\color{red}---}we dedicate this day to you.

\medskip
At every hour of the day, we give you glory,\\
{\color{red}---}in all our deeds, we offer you praise.

\medskip
Mary, your mother, was obedient to your word,\\
{\color{red}---}direct our lives in accordance with that word.

\medskip
Our lives are surrounded with passing things; set our hearts on things of heaven,\\
{\color{red}---}so that through faith, hope and charity we may come to enjoy the vision of your glory.
