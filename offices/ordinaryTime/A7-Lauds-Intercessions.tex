\begin{hangpar}

Let us all praise Christ. In order to become our faithful and merciful high priest before the Fatherâ€™s throne, he chose to become one of us, a brother in all things. In prayer we ask of him:\\
\emph{Lord, share with us the treasure of your love.}

\medskip Sun of Justice, you filled us with light at our baptism,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}we dedicate this day to you.

\medskip At every hour of the day, we give you glory,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}in all our deeds, we offer you praise.

\medskip Mary, your mother, was obedient to your word,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}direct our lives in accordance with that word.

\medskip Our lives are surrounded with passing things; set our hearts on things of heaven,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}so that through faith, hope and charity we may come to enjoy the vision of your glory.
