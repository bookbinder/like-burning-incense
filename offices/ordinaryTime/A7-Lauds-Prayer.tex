\prayer


\begin{prayerverse}
Lord,\\
free us from the dark night of death.\\
Let the light of resurrection\\
dawn within our hearts\\
to bring us to the radiance of eternal life.\\
We ask this through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\\
who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.
\end{prayerverse}
