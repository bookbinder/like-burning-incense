\hymn

\begin{verse}
O God, the source of all that is,\\
when you had finished all your works,\\
the compass of the universe\\
was filled with gifts in vast array.

And after forming such a world,\\
you took your rest, as it is said,\\
that we might find most welcome rest\\
and rise refreshed for daily work.

Now grant us in this mortal life\\
to weep in sorrow for our sins,\\
to persevere in righteousness\\
and prosper in your gracious gifts,

That when the final terror dawns,\\
before the dread and fearful Judge,\\
we all may find our perfect joy\\
together in your blessed peace.

Most loving Father, hear our prayer,\\
and you, O Christ coequal Son,\\
who with the Spirit Paraclete\\
now reign for all eternity. Amen.
\end{verse}
