God aids and protects the people he has chosen for his inheritance. Let us give thanks to him and proclaim his goodness:\\
\emph{Lord, we trust in you.}

\medskip We pray for N., our Pope, and N., our bishop,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}protect them and in your goodness make them holy.

\medskip May the sick feel their companionship with the suffering Christ,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}and know that they will enjoy his eternal consolation.

\medskip In your goodness have compassion on the homeless,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}help them to find proper housing.

\medskip In your goodness give and preserve the fruits of the earth,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}so that each day there may be bread enough for all.

\medskip (Or: Graciously protect our nation from evil,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}that it may prosper in your peace.

\medskip Lord, you attend the dying with great mercy,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}grant them an eternal dwelling.
