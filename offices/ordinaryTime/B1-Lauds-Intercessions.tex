Let us give thanks to our Savior who came into this world as Godâ€™s presence among us. Let us call upon him:\\
\emph{Christ, King of Glory, be our light and our joy.}

\medskip
Lord Jesus, you are the rising Sun, the firstfruits of the future resurrection,\\
{\color{red}---}grant that we may not sit in the shadow of death but walk in the light of life.

\medskip
Show us your goodness, present in every creature,\\
{\color{red}---}that we may contemplate your glory everywhere.

\medskip
Do not allow us to be overcome by evil today,\\
{\color{red}---}but grant that we may overcome evil through the power of good.

\medskip
You were baptized in the Jordan and anointed by the Holy Spirit,\\
{\color{red}---}grant that we may this day give thanks to your Holy Spirit.
