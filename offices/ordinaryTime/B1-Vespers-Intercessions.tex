All praise and honor to Christ! He lives for ever to intercede for us, and he is able to save those who approach the Father in his name. Sustained by our faith, let us call upon him:\\
\emph{Remember your people, Lord.}

\medskip As the day draws to a close, Sun of Justice, we invoke your name upon the whole human race,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}so that all men may enjoy your never failing light.

\medskip Preserve the covenant which you have ratified in your blood,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}cleanse and sanctify your Church.

\medskip Remember your assembly, Lord,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}your dwelling place.

\medskip Guide travelers along the path of peace and prosperity,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}so that they may reach their destinations in safety and joy.

\medskip Receive the souls of the dead, Lord,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}grant them your favor and the gift of eternal glory.
