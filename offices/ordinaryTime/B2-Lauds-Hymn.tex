\hymn

\begin{verse}
O God of splendor, source of light,\\
by your serene and shining ray\\
the day unfolds and floods the sky,\\
when hours of night have run their course.

For you are earth’s true morning star,\\
and not that star, so frail and small,\\
which shines with pale and narrow gleam,\\
as herald of the coming day;

But you are brighter than the sun,\\
the light itself, and perfect day,\\
who bring to light with piercing beam\\
the inmost regions of our hearts.

May chastity of mind and soul\\
subdue what flesh with pride desires\\
and keep the body chaste and pure,\\
the Spirit’s holy dwelling place.

O Christ, to you, most loving King,\\
and to the Father glory be,\\
one with the Spirit Paraclete,\\
from age to age for evermore. Amen.
\end{verse}
