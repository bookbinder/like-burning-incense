Our Savior has made us a nation of priests to offer acceptable sacrifice to the Father. Let us call upon him in gratitude:\\
\emph{Preserve us in your ministry, Lord.}

\medskip Christ, eternal priest, you conferred the holy priesthood on your people,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}grant that we may offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to the Father.

\medskip In your goodness pour out on us the fruits of your Spirit,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}patience, kindness and gentleness.

\medskip May we love you and possess you, for you are love,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}and may every action of our lives praise you.

\medskip May we seek those things which are beneficial to our brothers, without counting the cost,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}to help them on the way to salvation.
