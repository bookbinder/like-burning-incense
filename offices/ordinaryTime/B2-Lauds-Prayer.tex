\begin{verse}
Almighty Father,\\
you have brought us to the light of a new day:\\
keep us safe the whole day through\\
from every sinful inclination.\\
May all our thoughts, words and actions\\
aim at doing what is pleasing in your sight.\\
We ask this through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\\
who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.
\end{verse}
