\begin{verse}
Light ever-radiant, source of light and wellspring,\\
loving and gracious, hear the prayers we offer:\\
Light, come adorn us, banish with your splendor\\
   sin, born of darkness.

Lo, day has ended, with its weary labor,\\
and by your favor, we have been protected;\\
gladly we thank you at this hour and always\\
   for ev’ry blessing.

At the sun’s setting, darkness now enfolds us,\\
but may the true Sun, who with golden radiance\\
cares for the angels in their holy legions,\\
   grant us his splendor.

Christ, our Redeemer, merciful and gentle,\\
blot out the failings daylight hours have hidden;\\
let hearts shine brightly with unclouded splendor\\
   as the night passes.

Praise to the Father, to the Son all glory,\\
equal in power with the Holy Spirit,\\
ruling creation with sublime dominion\\
   through all the ages. Amen.
\end{verse}
