Let us praise Christ, who loves, nourishes and supports his Church. With faith let us cry out to him:\\
\emph{Answer the prayers of your people, Lord.}

\medskip Lord Jesus, grant that all men be saved,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}and come to the knowledge of truth.

\medskip Preserve our holy father, Pope N., and N., our bishop,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}come with your power to help them.

\medskip Remember those who long for honest work,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}so that they may lead a life of peaceful security.

\medskip Lord, be the refuge of the poor,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}their help in distress.

\medskip We commend to your care all bishops, priests and deacons who have died,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}may they sing your praises for ever around your heavenly throne.
