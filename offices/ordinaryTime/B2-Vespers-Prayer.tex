\begin{verse}
Almighty Father,\\
you have given us the strength\\
to work throughout this day.\\
Receive our evening sacrifice of praise\\
in thanksgiving for your countless gifts.\\
We ask this through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\\
who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.
\end{verse}
