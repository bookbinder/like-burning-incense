Let us bless our Savior who enlightens the world by his resurrection. Let us humbly beg him:\\
\emph{Keep us, Lord, on your path.}

Lord Jesus, we honor your resurrection in our morning prayer,\\
{\color{red}---}the hope of your glory enlightens our day.

\medskip
Accept, Lord, our prayers and petitions,\\
{\color{red}---}as the first fruits of our day.

\medskip
Grant that we may progress today in your love,\\
{\color{red}---}and that all things may work together for our good and the good of all.

\medskip
Make our light shine so brightly before men,\\
{\color{red}---}that seeing our good works they may give glory to the Father.
