Let us bless our Savior who enlightens the world by his resurrection. Let us humbly beg him:\\
\emph{Keep us, Lord, on your path.}

\medskip Lord Jesus, we honor your resurrection in our morning prayer,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}the hope of your glory enlightens our day.

\medskip Accept, Lord, our prayers and petitions,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}as the first fruits of our day.

\medskip Grant that we may progress today in your love,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}and that all things may work together for our good and the good of all.

\medskip Make our light shine so brightly before men,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}that seeing our good works they may give glory to the Father.
