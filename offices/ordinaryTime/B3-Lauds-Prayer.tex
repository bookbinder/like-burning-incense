\begin{prayerverse}
Lord Jesus Christ,\\
true light of the world,\\
you guide all mankind to salvation.\\
Give us the courage, strength and grace\\
to build a world of justice and peace,\\
ready for the coming of that kingdom\\
where you live with the Father and the Holy Spirit,\\
God for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.
