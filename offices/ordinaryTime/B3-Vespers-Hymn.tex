\hymn

\begin{verse}
Creator, sov’reign Prince of time,\\
who set the hours in fixed array,\\
you mark the light of day for work\\
and grant us night for sleep and rest.

Direct our hearts and keep them chaste,\\
lest silence shrouded in the night\\
expose us to our jealous foe,\\
who pierces souls with fearful wounds.

May hearts be free of vain desire\\
and bear no torch of ire or lust,\\
lest flames that touch and rouse our sense\\
should sap the strength of mind and soul.

Most loving Father, hear our prayer,\\
and you, O Christ, coequal Son,\\
who with the Spirit Paraclete\\
now reign for all eternity. Amen.
\end{verse}
