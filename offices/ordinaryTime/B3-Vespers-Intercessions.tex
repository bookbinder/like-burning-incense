Let us praise Christ, the shepherd and guardian of our souls, who loves and protects his people. Placing our hope in him, we cry out:\\
\emph{Protect your people, Lord.}

\medskip Eternal shepherd, protect our bishop N.,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}and all the shepherds of your Church.

\medskip Look kindly on those who suffer persecution,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}hasten to free them from all adversity.

\medskip Have mercy on the needy, Lord,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}provide food for the hungry.

\medskip Enlighten all legislators,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}to enact laws in the spirit of wisdom and justice.

\medskip Come to the aid of our departed brothers and sisters, whom you have redeemed with your blood,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}make them worthy to enter your wedding feast.
