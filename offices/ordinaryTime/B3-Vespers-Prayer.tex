\prayer


\begin{prayerverse}
Father,\\
yours is the morning\\
and yours is the evening.\\
Let the Sun of Justice, Jesus Christ,\\
shine for ever in our hearts\\
and draw us to that light\\
where you live in radiant glory.\\
We ask this through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\\
who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.
\end{prayerverse}
