\hymn

\begin{verse}
Creator of the radiant sky,\\
who fixed for light an ordered path,\\
who made the moon to govern night,\\
the sun to rule the course of days,

Dark night has now been cast away,\\
the splendor of the world reborn;\\
new vigor has restored the soul\\
and spurs us on to gracious deeds.

As day returns and rouses us\\
to sing once more your hymns of praise,\\
the bright, alluring face of heav’n\\
now calms our hearts and brings them peace.

May we avoid all sly deceit,\\
and may our mind shun wickedness;\\
let no misdeed defile our life,\\
no fault or error snare our tongue;

But, as the sun traverses day,\\
may faith be ardent, firm, and deep,\\
may hope incite to promised good,\\
may charity wed us to Christ.

Most loving Father, hear our prayer,\\
and you, O Christ coequal Son,\\
who with the Spirit Paraclete\\
now reign for all eternity. Amen.
\end{verse}
