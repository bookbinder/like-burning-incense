Blessed be God our Savior, who promised to remain with his Church all days, until the end of the world. Let us give him thanks and call out:\\
\emph{Remain with us, Lord.}

\medskip
Remain with us the whole day, Lord,\\
{\color{red}---}let your grace be a sun that never sets.

\medskip
We dedicate this day to you as an offering,\\
{\color{red}---}do not let us offer anything that is evil.

\medskip
May your gift of light pervade this whole day,\\
{\color{red}---}that we may be the salt of the earth and the light of the world.

\medskip
May the love of your Holy Spirit direct our hearts and our lips,\\
{\color{red}---}and may we always act in accordance with your will.
