Blessed be God our Savior, who promised to remain with his Church all days, until the end of the world. Let us give him thanks and call out:\\
\emph{Remain with us, Lord.}

\medskip Remain with us the whole day, Lord,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}let your grace be a sun that never sets.

\medskip We dedicate this day to you as an offering,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}do not let us offer anything that is evil.

\medskip May your gift of light pervade this whole day,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}that we may be the salt of the earth and the light of the world.

\medskip May the love of your Holy Spirit direct our hearts and our lips,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}and may we always act in accordance with your will.
