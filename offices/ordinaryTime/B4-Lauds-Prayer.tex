\begin{verse}
Lord,\\
as a new day dawns\\
send the radiance of your light\\
to shine in our hearts.\\
Make us true to your teaching;\\
keep us free from error and sin.\\
We ask this through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\\
who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.
\end{verse}
