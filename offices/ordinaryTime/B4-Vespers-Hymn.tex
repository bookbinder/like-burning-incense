\hymn

\begin{verse}
Behold, the slowly setting sun\\
departs from mountain, field, and sea;\\
it leaves with sadness, yet renews\\
the promise of tomorrow’s light.

For we in wonder recognize\\
that you, Creator, thus provide\\
and give to shadows, as to light,\\
the laws that guide the change of hours.

So while the darkness shrouds the sky\\
and weighs in silence on the world,\\
when pow’r and strength for labor fail,\\
then rest is sought with keen desire.

Endowed with faith and hope in you,\\
we find all blessing in your Light,\\
refulgent glory born from you:\\
your Word before the dawn of time.

He is the Sun that knows no end,\\
that never rises, never sets,\\
in whose protection earth exults,\\
whom heaven sings with endless joy.

Grant us at length to find our joy\\
for ever in this light serene,\\
repeating hymns of praise to you\\
and to the Son and Spirit blest. Amen.
\end{verse}
