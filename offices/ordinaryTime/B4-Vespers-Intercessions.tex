Beloved brothers and sisters, let us rejoice in our God, for he takes great delight in bestowing benefits on his people. Let us fervently pray:\\
\emph{Increase your grace and your peace, Lord.}

\medskip Eternal God, for whom a thousand years are like the passing day,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}help us to remember that life is like a flower which blossoms in the morning, but withers in the evening.

\medskip Give your people manna to satisfy their hunger,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}and living water to quench their thirst for all eternity.

\medskip Let your faithful ones seek and taste the things that are above,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}and let them direct their work and their leisure to your glory.

\medskip Grant us good weather, Lord,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}that we may reap the copious fruits of the earth.

\medskip Show the faithful departed the vision of your face,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}let them rejoice in the contemplation of your presence.
