Lord God,\\
holy is your name,\\
and renowned your compassion,\\
cherished by every generation.\\
Hear our evening prayer\\
and let us sing your praise,\\
and proclaim your greatness for ever.\\
We ask this through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\\
who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
