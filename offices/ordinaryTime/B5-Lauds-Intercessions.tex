Blessed be God, our Father, who protects his children and never spurns their prayers. Let us humbly implore him:\\
\emph{Enlighten us, Lord.}

\medskip We thank you, Lord, for enlightening us through your Son,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}fill us with his light throughout the day.

\medskip Let your wisdom lead us today, Lord,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}that we may walk in the newness of life.

\medskip May we bear hardships with courage for your nameâ€™s sake,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}and be generous in serving you.

\medskip Direct our thoughts, feelings and actions this day,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}help us to follow your providential guidance.
