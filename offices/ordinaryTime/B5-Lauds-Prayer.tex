\begin{verse}
Lord,\\
true light and source of all light,\\
listen to our morning prayer.\\
Turn our thoughts to what is holy\\
and may we ever live in the light of your love.\\
We ask this through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\\
who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.
\end{verse}
