Lift up your hearts to our Lord and Savior who gives his people every spiritual blessing. In the spirit of devotion, let us ask him:\\
\emph{Bless your people, Lord.}

\medskip Merciful God, strengthen N., our Pope, and N., our bishop,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}keep them free from harm.

\medskip Look favorably on our country, Lord,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}free us from all evil.

\medskip Call men to serve at your altar,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}and to follow you more closely in chastity, poverty and obedience.

\medskip Take care of your handmaidens vowed to virginity,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}that they may follow you, the divine Lamb, wherever you go.

\medskip May the dead rest in eternal peace,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}may their union with us be strengthened through the sharing of spiritual goods.
