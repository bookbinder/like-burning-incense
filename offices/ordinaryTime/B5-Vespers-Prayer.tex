\begin{verse}
Father of mercy,\\
hear our evening prayer of praise,\\
and let our hearts never waver\\
from the love of your law.\\
Lead us on through nightâ€™s darkness\\
to the dawning of eternal life.\\
We ask this through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\\
who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.
\end{verse}
