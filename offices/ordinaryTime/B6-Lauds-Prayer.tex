\begin{prayerverse}
All-powerful Father,\\
as now we bring you our songs of praise,\\
so may we sing your goodness\\
in the company of your saints for ever.\\
We ask this through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\\
who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.
