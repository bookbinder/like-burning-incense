\begin{hymnverse}
O Christ, Redeemer of the world,\\
protect and guide your servants here,\\
be pleased to hear the holy prayers\\
of Mary, Virgin ever blest.

O blessed hosts that dwell on high,\\
you heav’nly angels, rank on rank,\\
drive far from us all evils past,\\
all present wrongs, and future harm.

O Prophets of th<em>e</em> eternal Judge,\\
and great Apostles of the Lord,\\
on bended knee we beg your prayers\\
that by his love we may be saved.

O Martyrs, who are crowned by God,\\
Confessors clothed in bright array,\\
come with your prayers on our behalf\\
to lead us on the heav’nly path.

O choirs of holy Virgins, come,\\
and all monastic families,\\
that with the saints of ev’ry rank\\
we all may share the life of Christ.

Now with your voices join our prayer,\\
that we may pay our debt of praise,\\
and let us sing with lively joy:\\
All glory to the Three in One. Amen.
