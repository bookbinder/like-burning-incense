Let us bless Christ, the compassionate and merciful Lord, who wipes away the tears of those who weep. Let us cry out to him in love and ask:\\
\emph{Have mercy on your people, Lord.}

\medskip Lord Jesus, you console the humble,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}be attentive to the tears of the poor.

\medskip Merciful God, hear the cries of the dying,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}comfort them with your presence.

\medskip Make exiles aware of your providential care,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}may they return to their home on earth and finally enter their home in heaven.

\medskip Be merciful to sinners who have fallen away from your love,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}reconcile them to yourself and to your Church.

\medskip Save our brothers who have died,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}let them share in the fullness of redemption.
