\begin{prayerverse}
God our Father,\\
the contradiction of the cross\\
proclaims your infinite wisdom.\\
Help us to see that the glory of your Son\\
is revealed in the suffering he freely accepted.\\
Give us faith to claim as our only glory\\
the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ,\\
who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.
\end{prayerverse}
