\reading{1 Corinthians 2:7--10a}

\lettrine{W}{hat} we utter is God’s wisdom: a mysterious, a hidden wisdom. God planned it before all ages for our glory. None of the rulers of this age knew the mystery; if they had known it, they would never have crucified the Lord of glory. Of this wisdom it is written:   “Eye has not seen, ear has not heard
      nor has it so much as dawned on man
      what God has prepared for those who love him.”

Yet God has revealed this wisdom to us through the Spirit.
