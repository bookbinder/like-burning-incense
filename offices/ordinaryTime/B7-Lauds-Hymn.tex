\hymn

\begin{verse}
As daylight fills the sky once more,\\
let us with thanks and joyful voice\\
sing glory to the Lord our God\\
as we proclaim the grace of Christ,

Through whom the Maker of the world\\
decreed and fixed both night and day,\\
confirming by eternal law\\
that each proceed in ordered course.

True Light that shines on faithful hearts,\\
you are not bound by ancient law,\\
nor do you fail at close of day,\\
resplendent with eternal light.

O unbegotten Father, grant\\
that we may live throughout this day\\
filled with the Holy Spirit’s gifts,\\
intent on always praising Christ. Amen.
\end{verse}
