Let us celebrate the kindness and wisdom of Christ, He offers his love and understanding to all men, especially to the suffering. Let us earnestly pray to him:\\
\emph{Perfect us in love, Lord.}

\medskip
This morning we recall your resurrection,\\
{\color{red}---}and we long for the benefits of your redemption.

\medskip
Grant that we bear witness to you today, Lord,\\
{\color{red}---}and offer an acceptable gift to the Father through you.

\medskip
Enable us to see your image in all men,\\
{\color{red}---}and to serve you in them.

\medskip
Lord Jesus, you are the true vine and we are the branches,\\
{\color{red}---}allow us to remain in you, to bear much fruit and to give glory to the Father.
