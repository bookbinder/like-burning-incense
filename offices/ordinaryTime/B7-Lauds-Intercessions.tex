Let us celebrate the kindness and wisdom of Christ, He offers his love and understanding to all men, especially to the suffering. Let us earnestly pray to him:\\
\emph{Perfect us in love, Lord.}

\medskip This morning we recall your resurrection,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}and we long for the benefits of your redemption.

\medskip Grant that we bear witness to you today, Lord,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}and offer an acceptable gift to the Father through you.

\medskip Enable us to see your image in all men,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}and to serve you in them.

\medskip Lord Jesus, you are the true vine and we are the branches,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}allow us to remain in you, to bear much fruit and to give glory to the Father.
