\begin{verse}
Lord,\\
we praise you\\
with our lips,\\
and with our lives and hearts.\\
Our very existence is a gift from you;\\
to you we offer all that we have and are.\\
We ask this through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\\
who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.
\end{verse}
