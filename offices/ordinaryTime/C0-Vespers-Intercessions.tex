Christ had compassion on the hungry and performed a miracle of love for them. Mindful of this, let us pray:\\
\emph{Show us your love, Lord.}

\medskip Lord, we recognize that all the favors we have received today come through your generosity,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}do not let them return to you empty, but let them bear fruit.

\medskip Light and salvation of all nations, protect the missionaries you have sent into the world,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}enkindle in them the fire of your Spirit.

\medskip Grant that man may shape the world in keeping with human dignity,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}and respond generously to the needs of our time.

\medskip Healer of body and spirit, comfort the sick and be present to the dying,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}in your mercy visit and refresh us.

\medskip May the faithful departed be numbered among the saints,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}whose names are in the Book of Life.
