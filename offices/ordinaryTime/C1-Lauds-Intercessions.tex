Father, you sent the Holy Spirit to enlighten the hearts of men; hear us as we pray:\\
\emph{Enlighten your people, Lord.}

\medskip Blessed are you, O God, our light,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}you have given us a new day resplendent with your glory.

\medskip You enlightened the world through the resurrection of your Son,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}through your Church shed this light on all men.

\medskip You gave the disciples of your only-begotten Son the Spiritâ€™s gift of understanding,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}through the same Spirit keep the Church faithful to you.

\medskip Light of nations, remember those who remain in darkness,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}open their eyes and let them recognize you, the only true God.
