The world was created by the Word of God, re-created by his redemption, and it is continually renewed by his love. Rejoicing in him we call out:\\
\emph{Renew the wonders of your love, Lord.}

\medskip We give thanks to God whose power is revealed in nature,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}and whose providence is revealed in history.

\medskip Through your Son, the herald of reconciliation, the victor of the cross,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}free us from empty fear and hopelessness.

\medskip May all those who love and pursue justice,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}work together without deceit to build a world of true peace.

\medskip Be with the oppressed, free the captives, console the sorrowing, feed the hungry, strengthen the weak,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}in all people reveal the victory of your cross.

\medskip After your Sonâ€™s death and burial you raised him up again in glory,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}grant that the faithful departed may live with him.
