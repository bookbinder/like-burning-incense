\begin{verse}
O Splendor of the Father’s light,\\
emitting glorious Light from Light,\\
true Light of light and source of light,\\
the Day illuminating day,

Descend into our soul, true Sun,\\
resplendent with eternal ray;\\
pour out upon our mind and heart\\
the Holy Spirit’s radiant beam.

And to the Father let us pray,\\
the Father of all majesty,\\
the Father of all pow’r and grace:\\
may he remove the lure of sin.

May he imbue our acts with strength\\
and blunt the teeth of envious strife,\\
in harsh misfortune bring us good,\\
and grant the grace to persevere.

May he direct and rule our minds,\\
in bodies faithful, chaste, and pure;\\
may faith enkindled never know\\
the deadly poison of deceit.

Let Christ himself become our food,\\
our faith in him become our drink;\\
let us imbibe with deepest joy\\
the Spirit’s sober drunkenness.

Then let this day proceed with joy:\\
our modesty be like the dawn,\\
our faith resplendent as the noon,\\
our soul untouched by dusk and night.

The dawn rides forth along her course;\\
so let our perfect dawn arise:\\
both Son in Father wholly one,\\
and Father wholly in his Word. Amen.
\end{verse}
