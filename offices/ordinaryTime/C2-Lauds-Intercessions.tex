Man was created to glorify God through his deeds. Let us earnestly pray:\\
\emph{May we give glory to your name, Lord.}

\medskip
We bless you, Creator of all things,\\
{\color{red}---}for you have given us the goods of the earth and brought us to this day.

\medskip
Look with favor on us as we begin our daily work,\\
{\color{red}---}let us be fellow workers with you.

\medskip
Make our work today benefit our brothers and sisters,\\
{\color{red}---}that with them and for them we may build an earthly city, pleasing to you.

\medskip
Grant joy and peace to us,\\
{\color{red}---}and to all we meet this day.
