\begin{verse}
Lord God,\\
king of heaven and earth,\\
direct our minds and bodies throughout this day,\\
and make us holy.\\
Keep us faithful to your law in thought, word and deed.\\
Be our helper now and always,\\
free us from sin,\\
and bring us to salvation in that kingdom\\
where you live and reign with the Father and the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.
\end{verse}
