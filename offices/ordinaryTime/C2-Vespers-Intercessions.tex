Christ desires to lead all men to salvation. Let us implore him with all our heart:\\
\emph{Draw all things to yourself, Lord.}

\medskip Through your precious blood, Lord, you redeemed us from the slavery of sin,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}grant us the freedom of the sons of God.

\medskip Bestow your grace upon our bishop N., and upon all bishops,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}may they administer your sacraments with fervent joy.

\medskip Grant that all who seek the truth may find it,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}and in finding it may they desire it all the more.

\medskip Be present to comfort widows, orphans and all the abandoned, Lord,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}may they feel close to you and cling to you.

\medskip Receive our departed brethren into the heavenly kingdom,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}where with the Father and the Holy Spirit you will be all in all.
