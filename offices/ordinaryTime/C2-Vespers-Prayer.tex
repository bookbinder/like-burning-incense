\begin{verse}
God our Father,\\
at the close of day we come to you,\\
the light that never fades.\\
Shine in the darkness of our night\\
and forgive our sins and failings.\\
We ask this through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\\
who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.
\end{verse}
