\reading{James 4:11--12}

\lettrine{D}{o} not, my brothers, speak ill of one another. The one who speaks ill of his brother or judges his brother is speaking against the law. It is the law he judges. If, however, you judge the law you are no observer of the law, you are its judge. There is but one Lawgiver and judge, one who can save and destroy. Who then are you to judge your neighbor?
