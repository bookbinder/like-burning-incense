\begin{hymnverse}
Now dawn proclaims the sun’s approach\\
with rays so welcome to the earth;\\
with color she adorns the world\\
and clothes all things in fairest hue.

O Christ, the everlasting Sun,\\
you shine on us with living light;\\
we turn to you with hymns of praise\\
and long to find our joy in you.

You are the Wisdom from on high,\\
the Father’s Word through whom all things\\
in wondrous order shine with light\\
and so attract our minds and hearts.

Then, grant us children of the light,\\
to walk with zeal and eager step,\\
that always by our lives and acts\\
we show the Father’s light and grace.

Lord, grant that we may always speak\\
sincerely, with no trace of guile,\\
and that the sweetest joys of truth\\
may stir and raise our mind and heart.

O Christ, to you, most loving King,\\
and to the Father glory be,\\
one with the Spirit Paraclete,\\
from age to age for evermore. Amen.
