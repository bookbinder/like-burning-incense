Lord Jesus, by your blood you have purchased for yourself a new people. We adore you and beseech you:\\
\emph{Remember your people, Lord.}

\medskip Our King and our Redeemer, hear the praises of your Church at the beginning of this day,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}teach her to glorify your majesty without ceasing.

\medskip You are our hope and our strength, in you we trust,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}may we never despair.

\medskip Look kindly upon our weakness and hasten to our aid,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}for without you we can do nothing.

\medskip Remember the poor and the afflicted, do not let this day be a burden to them,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}but a consolation and a joy.
