\begin{prayerverse}
God our Father,\\
yours is the beauty of creation\\
and the good things you have given us.\\
Help us to begin this day joyfully in your name\\
and to spend it in loving service\\
of you and our fellow man.\\
We ask this through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\\
who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.
