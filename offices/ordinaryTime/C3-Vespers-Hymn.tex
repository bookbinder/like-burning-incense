\hymn

\begin{verse}
O mighty Author of the world,\\
you thrust chaotic waters back\\
and drew the dry land from the deep\\
to set the earth unmoved and still.

That burgeoning in fitting growth,\\
adorned with radiant bloom and flow’r,\\
she might be fertile, bearing fruit\\
and yielding welcome, pleasing food.

Now cleanse with fresh and verdant grace\\
the wounded soul that sin has parched,\\
that she, by tears, may purge her guilt\\
and wear away corrupt desire.

Then let her yield to your commands,\\
and keep her safe from evil ways;\\
may she delight in all good things\\
and know no deed that leads to death.

Most loving Father, hear our prayer,\\
and you, O Christ coequal Son,\\
who with the Spirit Paraclete\\
now reign for all eternity. Amen.
\end{verse}
