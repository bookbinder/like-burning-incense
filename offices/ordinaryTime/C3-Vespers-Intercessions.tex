God establishes his people in hope. Let us cry out to him with joy:\\
\emph{You are the hope of your people, Lord.}

\medskip We thank you, Lord,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}because in Christ you have given us all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.

\medskip O God, in your hands are the hearts of the powerful; bestow your wisdom upon government leaders,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}may they draw from the fountain of your counsel and please you in thought and deed.

\medskip The talents of artists reflect your splendor,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}may their work give the world hope and joy.

\medskip You do not allow us to be tested beyond our ability,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}strengthen the weak and raise up the fallen.

\medskip Through your Son you promised to raise men up on the Last Day,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}do not forget those who have died.
