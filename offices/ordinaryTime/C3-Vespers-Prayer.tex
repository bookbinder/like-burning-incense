\begin{verse}
Lord,\\
may our evening prayer rise up to you,\\
and your blessing come down upon us.\\
May your help and salvation be ours\\
now and through all eternity.\\
We ask this through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\\
who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.
\end{verse}
