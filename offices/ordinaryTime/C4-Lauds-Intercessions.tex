Christ nourishes and supports the Church for which he gave himself up to death. Let us ask him:\\
\emph{Remember your Church, Lord.}

\medskip
You are the Good Shepherd who has given life and light today,\\
{\color{red}---}make us grateful for these gifts.

\medskip
Look with mercy on the flock you have gathered together in your name,\\
{\color{red}---}let no one whom the Father has given you perish.

\medskip
Lead your Church in the way of your commandments,\\
{\color{red}---}may your Holy Spirit keep her faithful.

\medskip
Nourish the Church at the banquet of your Word and Bread,\\
{\color{red}---}strengthened by this food may she follow you in joy.
