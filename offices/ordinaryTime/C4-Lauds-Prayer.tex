\begin{verse}
Lord,\\
as daylight fills the sky,\\
fill us with your holy light.\\
May our lives mirror our love for you\\
whose wisdom has brought us into being,\\
and whose care guides us on our way.\\
We ask this through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\\
who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.
\end{verse}
