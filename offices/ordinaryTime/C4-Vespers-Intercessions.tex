\begin{hangpar}

Let us humbly pray to God who sent his Son as the Savior and exemplar of his people:\\
\emph{May your people praise you, Lord.}

\medskip Let us give thanks to God who chose us as the first-fruits of salvation,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}and who called us to share in the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.

\medskip May those who confess your holy name be united in your truth,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}and fervent in your love.

\medskip Creator of all things, your Son desired to work among us with his own hands,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}be mindful of all who earn their living by the sweat of their brow.

\medskip Be mindful of those who devote themselves to the service of their brothers,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}do not let them be deterred from their goals by discouraging results or lack of support.

\medskip Be merciful to the faithful departed,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}keep them from the power of the Evil One.
