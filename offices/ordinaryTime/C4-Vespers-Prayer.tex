\begin{verse}
Merciful Lord,\\
let the evening prayer of your Church\\
come before you.\\
May we do your work faithfully;\\
free us from sin\\
and make us secure in your love.\\
We ask this through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\\
who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.
\end{verse}
