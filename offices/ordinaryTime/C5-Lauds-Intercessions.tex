Let us joyfully cry out in thanks to God the Father whose love guides and nourishes his people:\\
\emph{May you be glorified, Lord, for all ages.}

\medskip
Most merciful Father, we praise you for your love,\\
{\color{red}---}for you wondrously created us and even more wondrously restored us to grace.

\medskip
At the beginning of this day fill our hearts with zeal for serving you,\\
{\color{red}---}so that our thoughts and actions may redound to your glory.

\medskip
Purify our hearts of every evil desire,\\
{\color{red}---}make us intent on doing your will.

\medskip
Open our hearts to the needs of all men,\\
{\color{red}---}fill us with brotherly love.
