\begin{verse}
All-powerful and ever-living God,\\
shine with the light of your radiance\\
on a people who live in the shadow of death.\\
Let the dawn from on high break upon us:\\
your Son our Lord Jesus Christ,\\
who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.
\end{verse}
