Let us call upon Christ, the Good Shepherd who comes to the aid of his people:\\
\emph{Hear us, O God our refuge.}

\medskip Blessed are you, Lord, for you graciously called us into your holy Church,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}keep us within the Church until death.

\medskip You have given the care of all the churches to N., our Pope,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}give him unfailing faith, lively hope and loving concern.

\medskip Grant the grace of conversion to all sinners,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}and the grace of true repentance to all men.

\medskip You were willing to live as a stranger in our world,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}be mindful of those who are separated from family and homeland.

\medskip To all the departed who have hoped in you,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}grant eternal peace.
