\begin{verse}
Lord,\\
we thank you for guiding us\\
through the course of this dayâ€™s work.\\
In your compassion forgive the sins\\
we have committed through human weakness.\\
We ask this through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\\
who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.
\end{verse}
