Raising our eyes to Christ, who was born and died and rose again for his people, let us cry out:\\
\emph{Save those you have redeemed by your blood, Lord.}

\medskip Blessed are you, Jesus, redeemer of mankind; you did not hesitate to undergo your passion and death,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}to redeem us by your precious blood.

\medskip You promised that you would provide living water, the fountain of eternal life,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}pour forth your Spirit upon all men.

\medskip You send disciples to preach the Gospel to all nations,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}help them to extend the victory of your cross.

\medskip You have given the sick and the suffering a share in your cross,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}give them patience and strength.
