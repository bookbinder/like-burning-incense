\intercessions

\begin{raggedright}
Raising our eyes to Christ, who was born and died and rose again for his people, let us cry out:\\
\emph{Save those you have redeemed by your blood, Lord.}

\medskip
Blessed are you, Jesus, redeemer of mankind; you did not hesitate to undergo your passion and death,\\
{\color{red}---}to redeem us by your precious blood.

\medskip
You promised that you would provide living water, the fountain of eternal life,\\
{\color{red}---}pour forth your Spirit upon all men.

\medskip
You send disciples to preach the Gospel to all nations,\\
{\color{red}---}help them to extend the victory of your cross.

\medskip
You have given the sick and the suffering a share in your cross,\\
{\color{red}---}give them patience and strength.
