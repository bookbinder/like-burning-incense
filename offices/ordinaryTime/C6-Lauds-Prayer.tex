\begin{prayerverse}
Father all-powerful,\\
let your radiance dawn in our lives,\\
that we may walk in the light of your law\\
with you as our leader.\\
We ask this through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\\
who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.
