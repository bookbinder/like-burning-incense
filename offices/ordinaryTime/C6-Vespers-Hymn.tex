\hymn

\begin{hymnverse}
O God, who shaped the human race,\\
alone you order all that is;\\
you bid the fertile earth bring forth\\
all kinds of beasts and creeping things.

And at the sound of your command\\
all living creatures huge and strong\\
are subject to the human race,\\
that each may serve in rank and kind.

Drive far from all your servants here\\
whatever through impurity\\
shall make its way into our acts\\
or plant itself in habits formed.

Grant us rewards of lasting joy,\\
bestow your many gifts of grace,\\
undo the bonds of bitter strife,\\
confirm your covenants of peace.

Most loving Father, hear our prayer,\\
and you, O Christ coequal Son,\\
who with the Spirit Paraclete\\
now reign for all eternity. Amen.
\end{hymnverse}
