Because of our sins the Father gave the Lord Jesus up to death, and for our justification he raised him up again. Let us pray:\\
\emph{Have mercy on your people, Lord.}

\medskip Hear our prayers and spare us as we confess our sins,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}grant us forgiveness and peace.

\medskip Your Apostle said: “Where sin abounds, grace abounds all the more,”

{\color{red}---\thinspace}forgive us our transgressions.

\medskip Lord, we have sinned, yet we have also acknowledged your infinite mercy,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}bring us to conversion.

\medskip Save your people from their sins, Lord,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}make them pleasing to you.

\medskip You opened Paradise to the thief who believed in you,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}do not close the gates of heaven to the faithful departed.
