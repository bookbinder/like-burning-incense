\begin{verse}
Father,\\
in your loving plan\\
Christ your Son became the price of our salvation.\\
May we be united with him in his suffering\\
so that we may experience the power of his resurrection\\
in the kingdom\\
where he lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.
\end{verse}
