\begin{hangpar}

With confidence let us pray to the Father who willed that the Virgin Mary should surpass all creatures in heaven and earth:\\
\emph{Look upon the Mother of your Son and hear our prayer.}

\medskip We are grateful to you, Father of mercy, for you gave us Mary to be our mother and our model,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}through her intercession cleanse our hearts.

\medskip You inspired Mary to be attentive to your word and faithful in your service,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}through her intercession give us the gifts of the Holy Spirit.

\medskip You strengthened Mary at the foot of the cross and filled her with joy at the resurrection of your Son,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}through her intercession relieve our distress and strengthen our hope.
