\begin{prayerverse}
God our Father,\\
fountain and source of our salvation,\\
may we proclaim your glory every day of our lives,\\
that we may sing your praise for ever in heaven.\\
We ask this through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\\
who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.
