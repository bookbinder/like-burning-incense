Everyone who waits for the Lord finds joy. Now we pray to him:\\
\emph{Look on us with favor, Lord, and hear us.}

\medskip Faithful witness, first-born of the dead, you washed away our sins in your blood,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}make us always remember your wonderful works.

\medskip You called men to be heralds of your good news,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}make them strong and faithful messengers of your kingdom.

\medskip King of peace, send your Spirit on the leaders of the world,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}turn their eyes toward the poor and suffering.

\medskip Protect and defend those who are discriminated against because of race, color, class, language or religion,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}that they may be accorded the rights and dignity which are theirs.

\medskip May all who died in your love share in your happiness,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}with Mary, our mother, and all your holy ones.
