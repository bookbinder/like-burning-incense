\hymn

\begin{verse}
Lo, night is waning, darkness now surrenders,\\
dawn, fresh and golden, glows with light and splendor;\\
with ev’ry effort, let us all together\\
   beg the Almighty,

That God may show us mercy and compassion,\\
drive away anguish, grant to us salvation;\\
then may he give us, as a loving father,\\
   heaven’s high Kingdom.

Grant this, we ask you, Godhead ever blessed,\\
equal and holy Father, Son, and Spirit,\\
through all creation, age to age reechoes\\
   your wondrous glory. Amen.
\end{verse}
