Open your hearts to praise the God of power and goodness, for he loves us and knows our needs:\\
\emph{We praise you, Lord, and trust in you.}

We bless you, almighty God, King of the universe, because you called us while we were yet sinners,\\
{\color{red}---}to acknowledge your truth and to serve your majesty.

\medskip
O God, you opened the gates of mercy for us,\\
{\color{red}---}let us never turn aside from the path of life.

\medskip
As we celebrate the resurrection of your beloved Son,\\
{\color{red}---}help us to spend this day in the spirit of joy.

\medskip
Give to your faithful, O Lord, a prayerful spirit of gratitude,\\
{\color{red}---}that we may thank you for all your gifts.
