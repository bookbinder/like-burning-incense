\reading{2 Timothy 2:8, 11--13}

\lettrine{R}{emember} that Jesus Christ, a descendant of David, was raised from the dead. You can depend on this:   If we have died with him,
      we shall also live with him;
   If we hold out to the end,
      we shall also reign with him.

But if we deny him he will deny us. If we are unfaithful he will still remain faithful, for he cannot deny himself.
