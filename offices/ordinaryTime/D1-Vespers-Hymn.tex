\begin{verse}
O light, O blessed Trinity\\
and ever perfect Unity,\\
the flaming sun now dims and sets;\\
come, flood our hearts with holy light.

We honor you with morning hymn\\
and pray to you with evening song:\\
may we in glory humbly praise\\
and worship you through ev’ry age.

We ask the Father and the Son\\
and beg the Spirit of them both:\\
Sustain us with your loving care,\\
who reign for ever Three in One. Amen.
\end{verse}
