Rejoicing in the Lord, from whom all good things come, let us pray:\\
\emph{Lord, hear our prayer.}

\medskip Father and Lord of all, you sent your Son into the world, that your name might be glorified in every place,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}strengthen the witness of your Church among the nations.

\medskip Make us obedient to the teachings of your apostles,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}and bound to the truth of our faith.

\medskip As you love the innocent,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}render justice to those who are wronged.

\medskip Free those in bondage and give sight to the blind,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}raise up the fallen and protect the stranger.

\medskip Fulfill your promise to those who already sleep in your peace,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}through your Son grant them a blessed resurrection.
