\intercessions

\begin{raggedright}
Because Christ hears and saves those who hope in him, let us pray:\\
\emph{We praise you, Lord, we hope in you.}

\medskip
We thank you because you are rich in mercy,\\
{\color{red}---}and for the abundant love with which you have loved us.

\medskip
With the Father you are always at work in the world,\\
{\color{red}---}make all things new through the power of your Holy Spirit.

\medskip
Open our eyes and the eyes of our brothers,\\
{\color{red}---}to see your wonders this day.

\medskip
You call us today to your service,\\
{\color{red}---}make us stewards of your many gifts.
