Because Christ hears and saves those who hope in him, let us pray:\\
\emph{We praise you, Lord, we hope in you.}

\medskip We thank you because you are rich in mercy,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}and for the abundant love with which you have loved us.

\medskip With the Father you are always at work in the world,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}make all things new through the power of your Holy Spirit.

\medskip Open our eyes and the eyes of our brothers,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}to see your wonders this day.

\medskip You call us today to your service,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}make us stewards of your many gifts.
