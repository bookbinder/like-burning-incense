\begin{prayerverse}
God our creator,\\
you gave us the earth to cultivate\\
and the sun to serve our needs.\\
Help us to spend this day\\
for your glory and our neighborâ€™s good.\\
We ask this through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\\
who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.
