Jesus does not abandon those who hope in him; therefore, let us humbly ask him:\\
\emph{Our Lord and our God, hear us.}

\medskip Christ our light, brighten your Church with your splendor,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}so that it may be for the nations the great sacrament of your love.

\medskip Watch over the priests and ministers of your Church,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}so that after they have preached to others, they themselves may remain faithful in your service.

\medskip Through your blood you gave peace to the world,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}turn away the sin of strife, the scourge of war.

\medskip O Lord, help married couples with an abundance of your grace,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}so that they may better symbolize the mystery of your Church.

\medskip In your mercy forgive the sins of all the dead,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}that they may live with your saints.
