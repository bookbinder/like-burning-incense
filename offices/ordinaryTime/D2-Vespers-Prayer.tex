\begin{verse}
Stay with us, Lord Jesus,\\
for evening draws near,\\
and be our companion on our way\\
to set our hearts on fire with new hope.\\
Help us to recognize your presence among us\\
in the Scriptures we read,\\
and in the breaking of bread,\\
for you live and reign with the Father and the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.
\end{verse}
