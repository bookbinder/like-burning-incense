\hymn

\begin{hymnverse}
Eternal Maker of the light,\\
all Light itself and perfect day,\\
your own true light that knows no end\\
remains untouched by night and gloom.

Now dawn is coming, day draws near,\\
night pales and quickly fades away:\\
behold the daystar, clear and bright,\\
that strikes and dims the light of stars.

Now we, rejoicing, rise from sleep\\
to sing our grateful praise to you,\\
for, as the sun brings back the day,\\
it overwhelms unseeing night.

And now we beg you, holy Lord:\\
Let not the pleasures of the flesh\\
creep in with sweet, alluring flame\\
to trap our minds in worldly guile.

Let not our anger stir up strife,\\
nor appetite provoke excess,\\
nor hungry greed for wealth pervert,\\
nor base indulgence seize our hearts.

But firmly and with sober mind,\\
steadfast in body, chaste, and pure,\\
in spirit wholly formed by faith,\\
so let us live this day for Christ.

Most loving Father, hear our prayer,\\
and you, O Christ coequal Son,\\
who with the Spirit Paraclete\\
now reign for all eternity. Amen.
