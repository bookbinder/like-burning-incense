\intercessions

\begin{raggedright}
To the God who gives us the joy of praising him this morning, and who strengthens our hope, let us pray:\\
\emph{Hear us, O Lord, for the glory of your name.}

\medskip
We thank you, God and Father of Jesus our Savior,\\
{\color{red}---}for the knowledge and immortality you have given us through him.

\medskip
Make us humble of heart,\\
{\color{red}---}help us to serve one another out of reverence for Christ.

\medskip
Pour out your Spirit on us, your servants,\\
{\color{red}---}make us sincere in our love for each other.

\medskip
You instructed man to labor and to exercise dominion over the earth,\\
{\color{red}---}may our work honor you and sanctify our brothers and sisters.
