To the God who gives us the joy of praising him this morning, and who strengthens our hope, let us pray:\\
\emph{Hear us, O Lord, for the glory of your name.}

\medskip We thank you, God and Father of Jesus our Savior,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}for the knowledge and immortality you have given us through him.

\medskip Make us humble of heart,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}help us to serve one another out of reverence for Christ.

\medskip Pour out your Spirit on us, your servants,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}make us sincere in our love for each other.

\medskip You instructed man to labor and to exercise dominion over the earth,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}may our work honor you and sanctify our brothers and sisters.
