\begin{hangpar}

Let us praise Christ who gives power and strength to his people, and let us entreat him with sincere hearts:\\
\emph{Hear us, O Lord, and we shall praise you for ever.}

\medskip Christ our strength, you called your faithful ones to your truth,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}mercifully grant them faith and perseverance.

\medskip Direct our leaders according to your will,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}and help them to keep us in peace.

\medskip You provided bread for the hungry crowd,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}teach us to share our resources with the needy.

\medskip Do not direct world leaders to give attention only to the needs of their own nations,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}but give them, above all, a respect and a deep concern for all peoples.

\medskip Grant blessed life and resurrection to our brothers who have fallen asleep,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}and may all those who have believed in you share in your glory.
