\begin{verse}
Lord,\\
may our evening prayer come before you\\
and let the faith our lips profess\\
live in the prayerful thoughts of our hearts.\\
We ask this through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\\
who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.
\end{verse}
