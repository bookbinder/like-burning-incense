Christ, the splendor of the Fatherâ€™s glory, enlightens us with his word. With deep love we call upon him:\\
\emph{Hear us, King of eternal glory.}

\medskip
Blessed are you, the alpha and the omega of our faith,\\
{\color{red}---}for you called us out of darkness into your marvelous light.

\medskip
You enabled the blind to see, the deaf to hear,\\
{\color{red}---}help our unbelief.

\medskip
Lord, keep us in your love, preserve our community,\\
{\color{red}---}do not let us become separated from one another.

\medskip
Give us strength in temptation, endurance in trial,\\
{\color{red}---}and gratitude in prosperity.
