Christ, the splendor of the Fatherâ€™s glory, enlightens us with his word. With deep love we call upon him:\\
\emph{Hear us, King of eternal glory.}

\medskip Blessed are you, the alpha and the omega of our faith,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}for you called us out of darkness into your marvelous light.

\medskip You enabled the blind to see, the deaf to hear,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}help our unbelief.

\medskip Lord, keep us in your love, preserve our community,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}do not let us become separated from one another.

\medskip Give us strength in temptation, endurance in trial,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}and gratitude in prosperity.
