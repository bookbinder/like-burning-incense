\begin{verse}
Father,\\
keep in mind your holy covenant,\\
sealed with the blood of the Lamb.\\
Forgive the sins of your people\\
and let this new day bring us closer to salvation.\\
We ask this through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\\
who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.
\end{verse}
