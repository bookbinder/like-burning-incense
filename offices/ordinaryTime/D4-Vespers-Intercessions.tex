With joyful hearts, let us praise the Eternal Father whose mercy toward his people is exalted to the heavens:\\
\emph{Let all who hope in you rejoice, Lord.}

\medskip Remember, Lord, that you sent your Son into the world to be its savior, not its judge,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}let his glorious death bring us salvation.

\medskip You ordained your priests to be ministers of Christ and stewards of your marvelous gifts,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}fill them with fidelity, wisdom and love.

\medskip You have called men and women to chastity for the sake of the kingdom,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}let them faithfully follow your Son.

\medskip From the beginning you intended husband and wife to be one,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}keep all families united in sincere love.

\medskip You sent Christ Jesus into the world to absolve the sins of men,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}free all the dead from their sins.
