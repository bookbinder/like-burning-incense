\begin{verse}
God our Father,\\
you have filled the hungry with the good things of heaven.\\
Keep in mind your infinite compassion.\\
Look upon our poverty:\\
and let us share the riches of your life and love.\\
We ask this through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\\
who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.
\end{verse}
