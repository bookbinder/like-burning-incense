\hymn

\begin{verse}
Now sunrise fills the sky with light,\\
so let us beg with humble prayer,\\
that God protect us from all harm\\
in all our works and acts this day.

May he restrain and calm our tongue,\\
lest voices clash in dreaded strife,\\
and may he shield our sight with care,\\
lest eyes be lured by vain delights.

Then let our inmost heart be pure\\
and free of senseless ignorance;\\
may sparing use of food and drink\\
wear down the lustful pride of flesh,

That, when the daylight hours have gone\\
and time has brought us night once more,\\
with hearts kept pure by self-restraint,\\
we may extol him in our song.

To God the Father glory be,\\
all honor to his only Son,\\
one with the Spirit Paraclete,\\
from age to age for evermore. Amen.
\end{verse}
