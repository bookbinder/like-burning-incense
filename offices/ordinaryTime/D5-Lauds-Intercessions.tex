Let us pray to God, who gives salvation to his people:\\
\emph{You are our life, O Lord.}

\medskip
Blessed are you, Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, for by your mercy we have been reborn to a living hope,\\
{\color{red}---}through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.

\medskip
You made man in your image and renewed him in Christ,\\
{\color{red}---}mold us into the likeness of your Son.

\medskip
Pour out your love through the Holy Spirit,\\
{\color{red}---}heal our hearts, wounded by hatred and jealousy.

\medskip
Today grant work to laborers, bread to the hungry, joy to the sorrowful,\\
{\color{red}---}grace and redemption to all men.
