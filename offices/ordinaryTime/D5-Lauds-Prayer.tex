\begin{verse}
Lord,\\
let the knowledge of salvation\\
enlighten our hearts,\\
so that, freed from fear and from the power of our enemies,\\
we may serve you faithfully all the days of our life.\\
We ask this through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son\\
who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.
\end{verse}
