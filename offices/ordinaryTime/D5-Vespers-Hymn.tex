\hymn

\begin{verse}
O gracious God, who fashioned day\\
resplendent with your radiant light,\\
we beg you for your glory, Lord,\\
as day rolls downward into dusk.

For now, hard pressed by eventide,\\
the waning sun begins to set:\\
enfolding all the world in night,\\
it keeps its own well-ordered course.

But you, O Lord and God most high,\\
let not the shadows of the night\\
surround and crush your servants here,\\
fatigued and worn by daily toil,

That hearts may not be left in gloom\\
when day withdraws from life and soul,\\
but shielded by your holy grace,\\
we may behold a happy dawn.

Most loving Father, hear our prayer,\\
and you, O Christ, coequal Son,\\
who with the Spirit Paraclete\\
now reign for all eternity. Amen.
\end{verse}
