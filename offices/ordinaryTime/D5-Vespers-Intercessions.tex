Let us pray to Christ, the light of the nations and the joy of every living creature:\\
\emph{Give us light, peace and security, Lord.}

\medskip Brilliant Light, Word of the Father, you came to save all men,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}lead the catechumens of your Church into your marvelous light.

\medskip Overlook our sins, Lord,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}for you are the source of forgiveness.

\medskip Lord, it is your will that men use their minds to unlock natureâ€™s secrets and master the world,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}may the arts and sciences advance your glory and the happiness of all peoples.

\medskip Look kindly on those who have dedicated themselves to the service of their fellow men,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}may they fulfill their work freely and completely.

\medskip Lord, you open the way and no one can close it,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}lead into your light those who have fallen asleep in the hope of resurrection.
