\begin{verse}
Lord,\\
hear the evening prayers we bring before you:\\
help us to follow in the footsteps of your Son\\
so that we may produce an abundant harvest of goodness\\
in patience and in faith.\\
We ask this through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\\
who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.
\end{verse}
