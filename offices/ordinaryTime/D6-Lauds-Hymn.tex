\hymn

\begin{verse}
O God, the light of heav’n above,\\
you open wide your great right hand,\\
to strew with light the firmament,\\
upheld by your paternal arm.

Already dawn has veiled the stars:\\
she lifts her streams of reddish gold\\
and with a moist and gentle breeze\\
baptizes earth with sparkling dew.

Now as the shades of night withdraw\\
and darkness fleeing, quits the sky,\\
the daystar, figure of the Christ,\\
bestirs and wakes the sleeping day.

O God, you are the Day of days,\\
and you alone the Light of light,\\
one God of pow’r throughout all things,\\
almighty Godhead, Three in One.

To you, O Savior, now we raise\\
our humble prayer on bended knee,\\
as with full voice we sing and praise\\
the Father and the Spirit blest. Amen.
