We trust in God’s concern for every person he has created and redeemed through his Son. Let us, therefore, renew our prayer to him:\\
\emph{Fulfill the good work you have begun in us, Lord.}

\medskip O God of mercy, guide us toward spiritual growth,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}fill our minds with thoughts of truth, justice and love.

\medskip For your name’s sake, do not abandon us for ever,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}and do not annul your covenant.

\medskip Accept us, for our hearts are humble and our spirits contrite,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}and those who trust in you shall not be put to shame.

\medskip You have called us to a prophetic vocation in Christ,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}help us proclaim your mighty deeds.
