\intercessions

\begin{raggedright}
We trust in God’s concern for every person he has created and redeemed through his Son. Let us, therefore, renew our prayer to him:\\
\emph{Fulfill the good work you have begun in us, Lord.}

\medskip
O God of mercy, guide us toward spiritual growth,\\
{\color{red}---}fill our minds with thoughts of truth, justice and love.

\medskip
For your name’s sake, do not abandon us for ever,\\
{\color{red}---}and do not annul your covenant.

\medskip
Accept us, for our hearts are humble and our spirits contrite,\\
{\color{red}---}and those who trust in you shall not be put to shame.

\medskip
You have called us to a prophetic vocation in Christ,\\
{\color{red}---}help us proclaim your mighty deeds.
