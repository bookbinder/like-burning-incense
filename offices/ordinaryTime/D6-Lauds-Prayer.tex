\begin{verse}
Lord,\\
fill our hearts with your love\\
as morning fills the sky.\\
By living your law may we have\\
your peace in this life\\
and endless joy in the life to come.\\
We ask this through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\\
who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.
\end{verse}
