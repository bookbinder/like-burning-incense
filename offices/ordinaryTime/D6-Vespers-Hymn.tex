\hymn

\begin{hymnverse}
Eleven hours have come and gone\\
and day has sped to eventide;\\
let us with eager mind and heart\\
fulfill our debt of song and praise.

O Christ, our daily task is done,\\
the work we do in your employ;\\
now grant to all who tend your vines\\
the gift of glory you have pledged.

Bestow your help on all our work\\
and give us rest when work is done;\\
by wages that you grant us now,\\
endow us for our future gain.

O Christ, to you, most loving King,\\
and to the Father glory be,\\
one with the Spirit Paraclete,\\
from age to age for evermore. Amen.
\end{hymnverse}
