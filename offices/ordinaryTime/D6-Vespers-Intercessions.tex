\begin{hangpar}

Let us pray to Christ, the source of hope for all who know his name:\\
\emph{Lord, have mercy.}

\medskip Christ, our frail humanity is prone to fall,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}strengthen us through your help.

\medskip Left to itself, our nature is inclined to sin,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}let your love always restore it to grace.

\medskip Lord, sin offends you, repentance pleases you,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}do not punish us in your wrath even when we have sinned.

\medskip You forgave the penitent woman, and placed the wandering sheep on your shoulders,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}do not deprive us of your mercy.

\medskip By your death on the cross you opened the gates of heaven,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}admit into your kingdom all who hoped in you.
