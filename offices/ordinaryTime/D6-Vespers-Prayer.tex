\begin{verse}
God our Father,\\
you brought salvation to all mankind\\
through the suffering of Christ your Son.\\
May your people strive to offer themselves to you as a living sacrifice\\
and be filled with the abundance of your love.\\
We ask this through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\\
who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.
\end{verse}
