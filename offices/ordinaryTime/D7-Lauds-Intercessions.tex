\intercessions

\begin{raggedright}
Let us adore God, who has given hope and life to the world through his Son, and let us humbly ask him:\\
\emph{Lord, hear us.}

\medskip
Lord, Father of all, you have brought us to the dawn of this day,\\
{\color{red}---}make us live with Christ and praise your glory.

\medskip
You have poured out faith, hope and love upon us,\\
{\color{red}---}keep them firmly rooted in our hearts.

\medskip
Lord, let our eyes be always raised up to you,\\
{\color{red}---}so that we may swiftly answer your call.

\medskip
Protect us from the snares and enticements of evil,\\
{\color{red}---}keep our feet from stumbling.
