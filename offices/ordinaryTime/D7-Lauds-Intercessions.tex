\begin{hangpar}

Let us adore God, who has given hope and life to the world through his Son, and let us humbly ask him:\\
\emph{Lord, hear us.}

\medskip Lord, Father of all, you have brought us to the dawn of this day,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}make us live with Christ and praise your glory.

\medskip You have poured out faith, hope and love upon us,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}keep them firmly rooted in our hearts.

\medskip Lord, let our eyes be always raised up to you,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}so that we may swiftly answer your call.

\medskip Protect us from the snares and enticements of evil,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}keep our feet from stumbling.
