\begin{verse}
All-powerful and ever-living God,\\
splendor of true light, and never ending day:\\
let the radiance of your coming\\
banish from our minds\\
the darkness of sin.\\
We ask this through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\\
who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.
\end{verse}
