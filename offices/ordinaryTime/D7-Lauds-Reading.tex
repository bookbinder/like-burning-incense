\reading{2 Peter 3:13--15a}

\lettrine{W}{hat} we await are new heavens and a new earth where, according to his promise, the justice of God will reside. So, beloved, while waiting for this, make every effort to be found without stain or defilement, and at peace in his sight. Consider that our Lordâ€™s patience is directed toward salvation.
