Christ rose from the dead and is always present in his Church. Let us adore him and say:\\
\emph{Stay with us, Lord.}

\medskip Lord, Jesus, victor over sin and death, glorious and immortal,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}be always in our midst.

\medskip Come to us in the power of your victory,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}and show our hearts the loving kindness of your Father.

\medskip Come to heal a world wounded by division,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}for you alone can transform our hearts and make them one.

\medskip Strengthen our faith in final victory:

{\color{red}---\thinspace}and renew our hope in your second coming.
