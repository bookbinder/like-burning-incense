\begin{verse}
Father,\\
in your love you have brought us\\
from evil to good and from misery to happiness.\\
Through your blessings\\
give the courage of perseverance\\
to those you have called and justified in faith.\\
Grant this through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\\
who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.

{\color{red}Or:}

O God, by whose grace,\\
though sinners, we are made just\\
and, though pitiable, made blessed,\\
stand, we pray, by your works,\\
stand by your gifts,\\
that those justified by faith\\
may not lack the courage of perseverance.\\
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\\
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.
\end{verse}
