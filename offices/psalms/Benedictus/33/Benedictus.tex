\FirstLetter{B}lessed be the Lord, the God of \pointup{I}srael;\Med\\
he has come to his people and set th\pointup{e}m free.\\
He has raised up for us a mighty s\pointup{a}vior,\Med\\
born of the house of his serv\pointup{a}nt David.

Through his holy prophets he promised of \pointup{o}ld\Flex\\
that he would save us from our \pointup{e}nemies,\Med\\
from the hands of all wh\pointup{o} hate us.\\
He promised to show mercy to our f\pointup{a}thers\Med\\
and to remember his holy c\pointup{o}venant.

This was the oath he swore to our father \pointupl{A}braham:\Med\\
to set us free from the hands of \pointup{o}ur enemies,\\
free to worship him without f\pointup{e}ar,\Flex\\
holy and righteous in h\pointup{\i}s sight\Med\\
all the days of \pointup{o}ur life.

You, my child, shall be called the prophet of the M\pointup{o}st High;\Med\\
for you will go before the Lord to prepare h\pointup{\i}s way,\\
to give his people knowledge of salv\pointup{a}tion\Med\\
by the forgiveness of th\pointup{e}ir sins.

In the tender compassion of \pointup{o}ur God\Med\\
the dawn from on high shall break \pointup{u}pon us,\\
to shine on those who dwell in darkness and the shadow \pointup{o}f death,\Med\\
and to guide our feet into the way \pointup{o}f peace.

Glory to the Father, and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginning, \pointup{\i}s now,\Med\\
and will be for ever. \pointupl{A}men.
