\FirstLetter{B}lessed be the Lord, the G\pointup{o}d of Israel;\Med\\
he has come to his people and s\pointup{e}t them free.\\
He has raised up for us a m\pointup{\i}ghty savior,\Med\\
born of the house of his s\pointup{e}rvant David.

Through his holy prophets he promised of \pointup{o}ld\Flex\\
that he would save us fr\pointup{o}m our enemies,\Med\\
from the hands of \pointup{a}ll who hate us.\\
He promised to show mercy t\pointup{o} our fathers\Med\\
and to remember his h\pointup{o}ly covenant.

This was the oath he swore to our f\pointup{a}ther Abraham:\Med\\
to set us free from the hands \pointup{o}f our enemies,\\
free to worship him without f\pointup{e}ar,\Flex\\
holy and righteous \pointup{\i}n his sight\Med\\
all the days \pointup{o}f our life.

You, my child, shall be called the prophet of th\pointup{e} Most High;\Med\\
for you will go before the Lord to prep\pointup{a}re his way,\\
to give his people knowledge \pointup{o}f salvation\Med\\
by the forgiveness \pointup{o}f their sins.

In the tender compassion \pointup{o}f our God\Med\\
the dawn from on high shall br\pointup{e}ak upon us,\\
to shine on those who dwell in darkness and the shad\pointup{o}w of death,\Med\\
and to guide our feet into the w\pointup{a}y of peace.

Glory to the Father, and t\pointup{o} the Son,\Med\\
and to the H\pointup{o}ly Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginn\pointup{\i}ng, is now,\Med\\
and will be for ev\pointup{e}r. Amen.
