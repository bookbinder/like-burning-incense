\FirstLetter{I} rejoice heartily in th\pointup{e} Lord,\Med\\
in my God is the joy \pointup{o}f my soul;\\
for he has clothed me with a robe of s\pointup{a}lvation,\Med\\
and wrapped me in a mantl\pointup{e} of justice,\\
like a bridegroom adorned with \pointup{a} diadem,\Med\\
like a bride bedecked w\pointup{\i}th her jewels.

As the earth brings forth \pointup{\i}ts plants,\Med\\
and a garden makes its gr\pointup{o}wth spring up,\\
so will the Lord God make justice \pointup{a}nd praise\Med\\
spring up before \pointup{a}ll the nations.

For Zion’s sake I will not b\pointup{e} silent,\Med\\
for Jerusalem’s sake I will n\pointup{o}t be quiet,\\
until her vindication shines forth like th\pointup{e} dawn\Med\\
and her victory like a b\pointup{u}rning torch.

Nations shall behold your vind\pointup{\i}cation,\Med\\
and all k\pointup{\i}ngs your glory;\\
you shall be called by a n\pointup{e}w name\Med\\
pronounced by the mouth \pointup{o}f the Lord.\\
You shall be a glorious crown in the hand of th\pointup{e} Lord,\Med\\
a royal diadem held b\pointup{y} your God.

No more shall men call you “F\pointup{o}rsaken,”\Med\\
or your land “D\pointup{e}solate,”\\
but you shall be called “My D\pointup{e}light,”\Med\\
and your l\pointup{a}nd “Espoused.”\\
For the Lord delights \pointup{\i}n you,\Med\\
and makes your l\pointup{a}nd his spouse.

As a young man marries \pointup{a} virgin,\Med\\
your Builder shall m\pointup{a}rry you;\\
and as a bridegroom rejoices in h\pointup{\i}s bride\Med\\
so shall your God rej\pointup{o}ice in you.

Glory to the Father and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
    and to the H\pointup{o}ly Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginning, \pointup{\i}s now,\Med\\
    and will be for ev\pointup{e}r. Amen.
