    \FirstLetter{S}trike up the instr\pointup{u}ments,\Flex\\
a song to my God with t\pointup{\i}mbrels,\Med\\
chant to the Lord with c\pointup{y}mbals.\\
Sing to him a n\pointup{e}w song,\Med\\
exalt and acclaim his n\pointup{a}me.

A new hymn I will sing to my G\pointup{o}d.\Flex\\
O Lord, great are you \pointup{a}nd glorious,\Med\\
wonderful in power and unsurp\pointup{a}ssable.

Let your every creat\pointup{u}re serve you;\Med\\
for you spoke, and they were m\pointup{a}de,\\
you sent forth your spirit, and they were cr\pointup{e}ated;\Med\\
no one can resist your w\pointup{o}rd.

The mountains to their bases, and the seas \pointup{a}re shaken;\Med\\
the rocks, like wax, melt before your gl\pointup{a}nce.\\
But to those wh\pointup{o} fear you,\Med\\
you are very m\pointup{e}rciful.

Glory to the Father and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
and to the Holy Sp\pointup{\i}rit:\\
as it was in the beginning, \pointup{\i}s now,\Med\\
and will be forever. Am\pointup{e}n.
