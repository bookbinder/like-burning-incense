\FirstLetter{M}y soul, give praise to the L\pointup{o}rd;\Flex\\
I will praise the Lord all m\pointup{y} days,\Med\\
make music to my God while \pointup{I} live.

Put no trust in pr\pointup{\i}nces,\Med\\
in mortal men in whom there is n\pointup{o} help.\\
Take their breath, they return t\pointup{o} clay\Med\\
and their plans that day come t\pointup{o} nothing.

He is happy who is helped by Jac\pointup{o}b’s God,\Med\\
whose hope is in the Lord h\pointup{\i}s God,\\
who alone made heaven \pointup{a}nd earth,\Med\\
the seas and all they c\pointup{o}ntain.

It is he who keeps faith f\pointup{o}r ever,\Med\\
who is just to those who are \pointup{o}ppressed.\\
It is he who gives bread to th\pointup{e} hungry,\Med\\
the Lord, who sets prison\pointup{e}rs free,

the Lord who gives sight to th\pointup{e} blind,\Med\\
who raises up those who are b\pointup{o}wed down,\\
the Lord, who protects th\pointup{e} stranger\Med\\
and upholds the widow \pointup{a}nd orphan.

It is the Lord who loves th\pointup{e} just\Med\\
but thwarts the path of th\pointup{e} wicked.\\
The Lord will reign f\pointup{o}r ever,\Med\\
Zion’s God, from age t\pointup{o} age.

Glory to the Father and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginning, \pointup{\i}s now,\Med\\
and will be forever. \pointupl{A}men.
