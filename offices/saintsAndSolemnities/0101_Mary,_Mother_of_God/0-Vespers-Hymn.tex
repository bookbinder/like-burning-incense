\settowidth{\versewidth}{where sin’s harmful law immersed them}

\begin{hymnverse}%%[\versewidth]
Of the Father’s heart begotten\\
ere the dawning of the world,\\
he is Alpha and Omega,\\
ancient source and final end\\
of all things that are and have been\\
and shall be in years to come.

He assumed a mortal body,\\
frail and needy, fit to die,\\
that the race of Adam’s children\\
might not perish, lost in death,\\
where sin’s harmful law immersed them\\
in the hidden depths of hell.

O how blest that splendor rising\\
when the Virgin, giving birth,\\
fruitful by the Holy Spirit,\\
our salvation brought to light;\\
and the child, the world’s Redeemer,\\
first revealed his sacred face.

Lo, the one whom through the ages\\
bards have sung with one accord,\\
whom the prophets in their writings\\
filled with faith had long foretold,\\
splendid child of ancient promise:\\
let creation sing him praise.

Praise and glory to the Father,\\
let our voices ring with song.\\
Praise and glory to Christ Jesus,\\
from the Virgin Mother born.\\
Endless glory to the Spirit,\\
high exalted Paraclete. Amen.
