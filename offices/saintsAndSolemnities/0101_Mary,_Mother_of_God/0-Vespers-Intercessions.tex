Blessed be the Lord Jesus, our Peace, who came to unite man with God. Let us pray to him in humility:\\
\emph{Lord, grant your peace to all.}

\medskip When you were born you showed your kindness and gentleness,

<span class=rubrica>–</span> help us always to be grateful for all your blessings.

\medskip You made Mary, your Mother, full of grace,

<span class=rubrica>–</span> give all people the fullness of grace.

\medskip You came to announce God’s good news to the world,

<span class=rubrica>–</span> increase the number of preachers and hearers of your word.

\medskip You desired to become our brother by being born of the Virgin Mary,

<span class=rubrica>–</span> teach men and women to love each other in mutual brotherhood.

\medskip You came as the Sun rising over the earth,

<span class=rubrica>–</span> show the light of your countenance to those who have died.
