O God, who through the fruitful virginity of Blessed Mary\\
bestowed on the human race\\
the grace of eternal salvation,\\
grant, we pray,\\
that we may experience the intercession of her,\\
through whom we were found worthy\\
to receive the author of life,\\
our Lord Jesus Christ your Son.\\
Who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
&ndash;&nbsp;Amen.
