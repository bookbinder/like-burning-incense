\settowidth{\versewidth}{When he comes forth, that gate shall close,}

\begin{hymnverse}%%[\versewidth]
The gate for Christ, so full of grace,\\
stands open that the King may pass.\\
When he comes forth, that gate shall close,\\
as in the past, for ever sealed.

The only Son of God most high\\
has left the Virgin’s royal hall;\\
Creator, Spouse, Redeeming Lord,\\
he comes as champion of his Church.

His Mother’s honor and her joy,\\
believers’ true unbounded hope,\\
the stone hewn from the mountain side\\
now comes to fill the earth with grace.

Let ev’ry soul with joy exult:\\
the Savior of the nations comes\\
as God and Lord of all the world,\\
to ransom those whom he has made.

All glory be to Christ the Lord,\\
the Father’ Sole-begotten Son,\\
born from the Virgin Mother’s womb,\\
made fruitful by the Spirit blest. Amen.
