Let us give glory to Christ who was born of the Virgin Mary by the power of the Holy Spirit, and let us pray to him in these words:\\
\emph{Son of the Virgin Mary, have mercy on us.}

\medskip Christ, born of the Virgin Mary, you are Wonder-Counselor and Prince of Peace,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}give your peace to the world.

\medskip Our King and our God, you have raised us up by your coming,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}help us to honor you all the days of our lives by our faith and our deeds.

\medskip You made yourself like us,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}in your mercy grant that we may become more like you.

\medskip You made yourself a citizen of our earthly city,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}grant that we may become citizens of our true homeland, your kingdom in heaven.

\medskip
