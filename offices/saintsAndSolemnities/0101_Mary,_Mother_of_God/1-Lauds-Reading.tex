\reading{Micah 5:2, 3, 4a}

\lettrine{T}{}he ruler in Israel will give them up, until the time\\
   when she who is to give birth has borne,\\
And the rest of his brethren shall return\\
   to the children of Israel.\\
He shall stand firm and shepherd his flock\\
   by the strength of the Lord,\\
   in the majestic name of the Lord, his God.\\
He shall be peace.
