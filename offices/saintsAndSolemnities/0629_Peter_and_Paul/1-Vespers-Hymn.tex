\begin{hymnverse}
O blessed city, Rome in purple richly clad\\
by such great Princes, pouring forth their precious blood!\\
You shine in beauty, far surpassing all the world,\\
not by your praises, but by merits of these Saints\\
whom you once slaughtered with your cruel and bloody swords.

And so we beg you, glorious Martyrs, hear us now,\\
O blessed Peter, Paul the lily of the world,\\
triumphant warriors, dwelling in the halls of heav’n,\\
protect and shield us by your gracious, loving prayers,\\
keep us from evil, lead us high beyond the stars.

Praise to the Father, endless glory through all time,\\
all rule and splendor be to you, Begotten Son,\\
all pow’r and honor to the Holy Paraclete:\\
so to the perfect, undivided Three in One,\\
be all salvation through the ages evermore. Amen.
\end{hymnverse}
