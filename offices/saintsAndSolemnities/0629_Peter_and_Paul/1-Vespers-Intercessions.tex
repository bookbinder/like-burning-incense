The Lord Jesus built his holy people on the foundation of the apostles and prophets. In faith let us pray:\\
\emph{Lord, come to the aid of your people.}

\medskip You once called Simon, the fisherman, to catch men,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}now summon new workers who will bring the message of salvation to all peoples.

\medskip You calmed the waves so that your followers would not be drowned,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}guard your Church, protect it from all dangers.

\medskip You gathered your scattered flock around Peter after the resurrection,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}good Shepherd, bring all your people together as one flock.

\medskip You sent Paul as apostle to preach the good news to the Gentiles,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}let the word of salvation be proclaimed to all mankind.

\medskip You gave the keys of your kingdom into the hands of your holy Church,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}open the gates of that kingdom to all who trusted in your mercy while on earth.
