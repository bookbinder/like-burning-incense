\reading{1 Corinthians 15:3-5, 8a}

\lettrine{I}{ handed on to you} first of all what I myself received, that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures; that he was buried and, in accordance with the Scriptures, rose on the third day; that he was seen by Cephas, then by the Twelve. Last of all he was seen by me.
