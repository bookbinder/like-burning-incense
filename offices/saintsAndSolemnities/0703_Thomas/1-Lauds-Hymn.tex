\begin{hymnverse}
O Thomas, filled with greatest light\\
amid the Apostles’ glorious ranks,\\
receive with kindness as we sing\\
the joyous praise we offer you.

Now Christ with love has seated you\\
upon a throne of brilliant light,\\
as once with eager love for him\\
you longed to share the Master’s death.

Your love was torment as you heard\\
the brothers telling what they saw;\\
you looked for proof to quell your doubts:\\
to see and touch the Savior’s wounds.

What wondrous joy then filled your heart\\
when in his mercy Christ appeared;\\
with faith you call him Lord and God,\\
with deepest fervor you adore.

And so for us who have not seen,\\
our faith is keener through your sight,\\
our zeal is stronger through your touch,\\
a zeal by which we seek Christ’s love.

All praise and glory be to Christ,\\
and as you pray, may he bestow\\
on us who walk by faith alone\\
the joy to see him evermore. Amen.
\end{hymnverse}
