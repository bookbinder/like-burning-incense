Beloved friends, we have inherited heaven along with the apostles. Let us give thanks to the Father for all his gifts:\\
\emph{The company of apostles praises you, O Lord.}

\medskip Praise be to you, Lord, for the banquet of Christ's body and blood given us through the apostles,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}which refreshes us and gives us life

\medskip Praise be to you, Lord, for the feast of your word prepared for us by the apostles,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}giving us light and joy.

\medskip Praise be to you, Lord, for your holy Church, founded on the apostles,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}where we are gathered together into your community.

\medskip Praise be to you, Lord, for the cleansing power of baptism and penance that you have entrusted to your apostles,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}through which we are cleansed of our sins.

\end{hangpar}
