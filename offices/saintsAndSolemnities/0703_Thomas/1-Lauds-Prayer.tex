Almighty Father,\\
as we honor Thomas the apostle,\\
let us always experience the help of his prayers.\\
May we have eternal life by believing in Jesus,\\
whom Thomas acknowledged as Lord,\\
for he lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\

\begin{verse}
Grant, almighty God,\\
that we may glory in the Feast of the blessed Apostle Thomas,\\
so that we may always be sustained by his intercession\\
and, believing, may have life\\
in the name of Jesus Christ your Son,\\
whom Thomas acknowledged as the Lord.\\
Who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
