HYMN</span>

The dawn arises clear and bright\\
that heralds Christ in victory,\\
whom you, O Mary, long to see\\
and with your oil anoint his flesh.

With breathless haste you quickly run:\\
behold, an angel cries with joy\\
that he whom you so long to see\\
has burst the gates of death and comes!

Then you implore the gard’ner there,\\
though you behold your Master’s face;\\
yet for your faithful love you find\\
a sure reward of greater joy.

Since with the Virgin in her grief\\
you stood beside his bitter Cross,\\
you were the first to testify\\
that he is risen from the dead.

O fairest flow’r of Magdala,\\
O Mary, wounded by his love,\\
obtain, that we with hearts aflame\\
may burn with fervent love for Christ.

Grant us, O Christ, to imitate\\
so great a servant in her love,\\
and may we sing with heav’nly choirs\\
your praise and glory evermore. Amen.
