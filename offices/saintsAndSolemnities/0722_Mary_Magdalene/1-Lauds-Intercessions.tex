My brothers, with all the holy women, let us profess our faith in our Savior and call upon him:\\
\emph{Come, Lord Jesus.}

\medskip Lord Jesus, you forgave the sinful woman because she loved much,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}forgive us who have sinned much.

\medskip Lord Jesus, the holy women ministered to your needs during your journeys,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}help us to follow your footsteps.

\medskip Lord Jesus, master, Mary listened to your words while Martha served your needs,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}help us to serve you with love and devotion.

\medskip Lord Jesus, you call everyone who does your will your brother, sister, and mother,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}help us to do what is pleasing to you in word and action.
