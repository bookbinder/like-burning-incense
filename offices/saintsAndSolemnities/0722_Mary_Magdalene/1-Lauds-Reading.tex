\reading{Romans 12:1--2}

\lettrine{B}{}rothers, I beg you through the mercy of God to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice holy and acceptable to God, your spiritual worship. Do not conform yourselves to this age but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, so that you may judge what is Godâ€™s will, what is good, pleasing and perfect.
