\begin{hymnverse}
O James, our hymns with joyful praise\\
extol your name and holy life,\\
for as you fished and mended nets,\\
Christ raised you to such noble heights.

When at his call your heart was stirred,\\
you left all things to follow him;\\
together with your brother John\\
you boldly preached his word and Name.

Great witness of his strong right hand,\\
you saw the deep and hidden things:\\
high glory on the mountain peak\\
and in the garden anguished grief.

And when required, you promptly stood\\
to drink the cup of bitter pain;\\
among the Apostles you were first\\
to suffer death for love of Christ.

O true disciple of the Lord\\
and sower of his heav’nly light,\\
obtain that minds may shine with faith\\
and hearts be strong with fervent hope.

May we be zealous in this life\\
to follow precepts framed by Christ,\\
that we may pour forth hymns at last\\
and sing his glory evermore. Amen.
\end{hymnverse}
