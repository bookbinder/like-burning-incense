\begin{hymnverse}
Let heav’n exult with highest praise,\\
let earth with joy and gladness ring:\\
this sacred hour extols in song\\
the Apostles’ glory on this feast.

O righteous judges of the age,\\
true lights sent forth to all the world,\\
we raise our hearts in fervent prayer;\\
with kindness hear our humble plea.

By word you bar the gate of heav’n,\\
by word you draw and loose the bolt;\\
by your command, we beg of you:\\
Release us from the pow’r of sin.

The health and weakness of us all\\
is subject to your gracious care;\\
restore our virtue and our strength\\
and heal the sick in mind and heart,

That when the end of time has come\\
and Christ our Lord shall sit as Judge,\\
he may bestow on us a share\\
in joy that lasts for evermore.

All praise and glory be to God,\\
who grants us through your gracious aid\\
to learn the Gospel’s sacred truths\\
and seek the heav’nly things above. Amen.
