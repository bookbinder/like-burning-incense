My brothers and sisters, we build on the foundation of the apostles. Let us pray to our almighty Father for his holy people and say:\\
\emph{Be mindful of your Church, O Lord.}

\medskip Father, you wanted your Son to be seen first by the apostles after the resurrection from the dead,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}we ask you to make us his witnesses to the farthest corners of the world.

\medskip You sent your Son to preach your good news to the poor,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}help us to preach this Gospel to every creature.

\medskip You sent your Son to sow the seed of unending life,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}grant that we who work at sowing the seed may share the joy of the harvest.

\medskip You sent your Son to reconcile all to you through his blood,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}help us all to work toward achieving this reconciliation.

\medskip Your Son sits at your right hand in heaven,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}let the dead enter your kingdom of joy.
