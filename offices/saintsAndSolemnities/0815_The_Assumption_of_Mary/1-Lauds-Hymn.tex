\begin{hymnverse}[\versewidth]
O fairest Virgin, clothed in rays of sunlight,\\
twelve stars from heaven crown your head with splendor;\\
your feet are resting on the moon your footstool,\\
   all glorious Lady.

Mary, who vanquish death and hell and evil,\\
Christ has enthroned you, by his side in glory;\\
earth and sky claim you, mighty Queen of heaven,\\
   our gracious patron.

Guard those who follow godly faith and teaching,\\
lead back the scattered to the holy sheepfold,\\
gather from all sides nations long in darkness,\\
   veiled by death’s shadow.

Ask, gentle Lady, pardon for the guilty,\\
comfort the weeping, aid the sick and needy,\\
shine like a beacon through all life’s misfortunes,\\
   hope of salvation.

Praise in the highest be to God the Father,\\
Trinity blessed, crowning you in heaven\\
Queen of creation, holy Virgin Mother,\\
   our gracious Lady. Amen.
