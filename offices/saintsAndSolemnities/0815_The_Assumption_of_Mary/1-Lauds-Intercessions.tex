\begin{hangpar}

Let us glorify our Savior, who chose the Virgin Mary for his mother. Let us ask him:\\
\emph{May your mother intercede for us, Lord.}

\medskip Eternal Word, you chose Mary as the uncorrupted ark of your dwelling place,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}free us from the corruption of sin.

\medskip You are our redeemer, who made the immaculate Virgin Mary your purest home and the sanctuary of the Holy Spirit,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}make us temples of your Spirit for ever.

\medskip King of kings, you lifted up your mother, body and soul into heaven,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}help us to fix our thoughts on things above.

\medskip Lord of heaven and earth, you crowned Mary and set her at your right hand as queen,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}make us worthy to share this glory.
