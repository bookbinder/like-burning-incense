\begin{hymnverse}%%[\versewidth]
Christ Jesus, clothed in splendid light,\\
redeems all nations by his love;\\
let all the faithful ev’rywhere\\
extol him with a hymn of praise

While thirty years have run their course,\\
in human flesh he lives our life\\
and, though he lacks all stain of sin,\\
for us, he asks to be baptized.

Then blessed John recoils in fear,\\
to plunge him in the flowing tide,\\
beholding him, who by his blood\\
can cleanse the world of every sin.

And so the Father’s voice on high\\
resounds in witness to his Son;\\
the Spirit’s mighty pow’r pours forth,\\
the source of ev’ry holy gift.

To you, O Christ, we lift our voice:\\
Protect us all, we humbly pray,\\
and fill our minds and hearts with light,\\
that cleansed, we all may live for you.

All glory be to you, O Christ;\\
the Father and the Spirit blest,\\
in splendor from the heights of heav’n,\\
reveal that you are Light and Truth. Amen.
