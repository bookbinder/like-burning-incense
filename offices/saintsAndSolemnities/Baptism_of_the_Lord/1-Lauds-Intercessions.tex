Our Redeemer desired to be baptized in the Jordan by John; let us make this prayer to him:\\
\emph{Lord, have mercy.}

\medskip Christ, you made your light shine on us by revealing yourself,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}grant us the spirit of humble service to all people.

\medskip Christ, you humbled yourself and received baptism from your servant to show us the way of humility,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}grant us the spirit of humble service to our fellow men.

\medskip Christ, through your baptism you cleansed us of every blemish and made us children of your Father,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}bestow your spirit of adoption on all who seek you.

\medskip Christ, through baptism you have consecrated creation and opened the door of repentance to all who prepare for baptism,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}make us servants of your Gospel in the world.

\medskip Christ, through your baptism you revealed to us the Holy Trinity when the Father called you his beloved Son and the Holy Spirit came down upon you,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}renew the spirit of adoption among the royal priesthood of the baptized.

\medskip
