\reading{Isaiah 61:1--2a}

\lettrine{T}{he} spirit of the Lord God is upon me,\\
   because the Lord has anointed me;\\
He has sent me to bring glad tidings to the lowly,\\
   to heal the broken hearted,\\
To proclaim liberty to the captives\\
   and release to the prisoners,\\
To announce a year of favor from the Lord.
