\begin{hymnverse}%%[\versewidth]
As John fulfilled his sacred charge,\\
Christ Jesus, Author of the world,\\
immersed this day in Jordan’s tide,\\
by bathing, washed its waters clean.

Born from the Virgin Mother’s womb,\\
he did not need to be baptized,\\
yet by his washing, he desired,\\
to take away our guilt and sin.

The Father speaks, his voice proclaims:\\
This is my own beloved Son;\\
from heaven’s height on him descends,\\
in dove-like form, the Spirit blest.

Beneath the myst’ry of this Name,\\
salvation shines within the Church;\\
the Trinity abides with her,\\
one God through every time and place.

All glory be to you, O Christ;\\
the Father and the Spirit blest,\\
in splendor from the heights of heav’n,\\
reveal that you are Life and Truth. Amen.
