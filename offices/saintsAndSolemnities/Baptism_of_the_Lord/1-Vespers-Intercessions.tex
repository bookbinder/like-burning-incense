Our Redeemer desired to be baptized in the Jordan by John; let us make our petition to him:\\
\emph{Lord send forth your Spirit upon us.}

\medskip Christ, Servant of God, the Father acknowledged you as his own Son with whom he was pleased,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}send forth your Spirit upon us.

\medskip Christ, Chosen One of God, you did not break the crushed reed or extinguish the wavering flame,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}have mercy on all who are seeking you in good faith.

\medskip Christ, Son of God, the Father called you to be a light to the nations in the new covenant,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}open the eyes of the blind by the waters of baptism.

\medskip Christ, Savior of mankind, the Father anointed you with the Holy Spirit for the ministry of salvation,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}lead all mankind to see you and to believe in you, that they may have eternal life.

\medskip Christ, our hope, you lead those in darkness to the light of salvation,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}receive our departed brothers and sisters into your kingdom.
