\begin{prayerverse}

Almighty, eternal God,\\
when the Spirit descended upon Jesus\\
at his baptism in the Jordan,\\
you revealed him as your own beloved Son.\\
Keep us, your children born of water and the Spirit,\\
faithful to our calling.\\
We ask this through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\\
who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.

\begin{prayerverse}

Almighty ever-living God,\\
who, when Christ had been baptized in the River Jordan\\
and as the Holy Spirit descended upon him,\\
solemnly declared him your beloved Son,\\
grant that your children by adoption,\\
reborn of water and the Holy Spirit,\\
may always be well pleasing to you.\\
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\\
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.
