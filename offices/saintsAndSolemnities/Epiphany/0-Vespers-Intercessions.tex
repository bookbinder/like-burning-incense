Today, our Savior was adored by the Magi. Let us also worship him with joy as we pray:\\
\emph{Save the poor, O Lord.}

\medskip King of the nations, you called the Magi to adore you as the first representatives of the nations,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}give us a willing spirit of adoration and service.

\medskip King of glory, you judge your people with justice,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}grant mankind an abundant measure of peace.

\medskip King of ages, you endure from age to age,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}send your word as fresh spring rain falling on our hearts.

\medskip King of justice, you desire to free the poor who have no advocate,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}be compassionate to the suffering and the afflicted.

\medskip Lord, your name is blessed for ages,

<span>â€”</span> show the wonders of your saving power to our deceased brothers and sisters.
