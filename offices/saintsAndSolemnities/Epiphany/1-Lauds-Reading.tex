\reading{Isaiah 52:7--10}

\lettrine{H}{}ow beautiful upon the mountains\\
   are the feet of him who brings glad tidings,\\
Announcing peace, bearing good news,\\
   announcing salvation, and saying to Zion,\\
   “Your God is King!”\\
Hark! Your watchmen raise a cry,\\
   together they shout for joy,\\
For they see directly, before their eyes,\\
   the Lord restoring Zion.\\
Break out together in song,\\
   O ruins of Jerusalem!\\
For the Lord comforts his people,\\
   he redeems Jerusalem.\\
The Lord has bared his holy arm\\
   in the sight of all the nations;\\
All the ends of the earth will behold\\
   the salvation of our God.
