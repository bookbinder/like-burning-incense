\begin{hymnverse}%%[\versewidth]
Christ, the Father’s Splendor,\\
Mary, God’s own Mother,\\
Joseph, blessed guardian\\
of such holy pledges:

Your home shines in radiance,\\
with the flow’rs of virtue,\\
whence the Font of graces\\
comes with mercy flowing.

Angels view in wonder\\
God’s own Son, an infant,\\
clothed in servant’s nature,\\
serving us, his servants.

Joseph, humble leader,\\
though the least, you guide him;\\
Mary, you direct him,\\
serving both with kindness.

This poor home surpasses\\
ev’ry court and palace,\\
harboring salvation\\
for the human fam’ly.

Jesus, Mary, Joseph,\\
grant us and our fam’lies\\
joy and gifts most holy\\
from your humble dwelling.

Praise to you, Christ Jesus,\\
for to us you offer\\
hope that through your parents,\\
we come home to heaven. Amen.
