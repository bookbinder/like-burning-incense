Let us adore the Son of the living God who humbled himself to become a son of a human family, and let us beseech him:\\
\emph{Jesus, you became obedient; sanctify us.}

\medskip Jesus, eternal Word of the Father, you made yourself subject to Mary and Joseph,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}teach us humility.

\medskip You are our teacher, and your own mother pondered in her heart every one of your words and deeds,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}make us attentive to your word, and let us ponder it in hearts that are pure and good.

\medskip Christ, by your work the world was made, but you were willing to be called a workerâ€™s son,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}teach us to work diligently.

\medskip Jesus, in the family at Nazareth you grew in wisdom, age, and grace before God and man,

{\color{red}---\thinspace}help us to grow in all things toward you, our Head.
