Since lyluatex does its includes from the current working directory,
and not from the directory of the tex document in question, then if I want
to use one Score file in the saintsAndSolemnities directory instead having
a Score file for each subdirectory, then I need to use absolute paths in files
like 0531_The_Visitation_of_Mary/1-Lauds-1-Ant-Cantor.ly, etc.
