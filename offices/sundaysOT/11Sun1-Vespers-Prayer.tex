Almighty God,\\
our hope and our strength,\\

\begin{prayerverse}
O God, strength of those who hope in you,\\
graciously hear our pleas,\\
and, since without you mortal frailty can do nothing,\\
grant us always the help of your grace,\\
that in following your commands\\
we may please you by our resolve and our deeds.\\
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\\
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.
