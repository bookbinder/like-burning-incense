Father,\\
through the obedience of Jesus,\\
your servant and your Son,\\
you raised a fallen world.\\
Free us from sin\\
and bring us the joy that lasts for ever.\\
We ask this through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\\
who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\

\begin{prayerverse}
O God, who in the abasement of your Son\\
have raised up a fallen world,\\
fill your faithful with joy,\\
for on those you have rescued from slavery to sin\\
you bestow eternal gladness.\\
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\\
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.
