God, our Father,\\
your light of truth\\
guides us to the way of Christ.\\
May all who follow him\\
reject what is contrary to the Gospel.\\
We ask this through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\\
who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\

\begin{verse}
O God, who show the light of your truth\\
to those who go astray,\\
so that they may return to the right path,\\
give all who for the faith they profess\\
are accounted Christians\\
the grace to reject whatever is contrary to the name of Christ\\
and to strive after all that does it honor.\\
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\\
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.
\end{verse}
