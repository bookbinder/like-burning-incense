\begin{verse}
God our Father and protector,\\
without you nothing is holy,\\
nothing has value.\\
Guide us to everlasting life\\
by helping us to use wisely\\
the blessings you have given to the world.\\
We ask this through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\\
who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
O God, protector of those who hope in you,\\
without whom nothing has firm foundation, nothing is holy,\\
bestow in abundance your mercy upon us\\
and grant that, with you as our ruler and guide,\\
we may use the good things that pass\\
in such a way as to hold fast even now\\
to those that ever endure.\\
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\\
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.
