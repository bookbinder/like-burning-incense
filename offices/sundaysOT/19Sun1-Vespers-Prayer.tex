Almighty and ever-living God,\\
your Spirit made us your children,\\
confident to call you Father.\\
Increase your Spirit within us\\
and bring us to our promised inheritance.\\
Help us to be like him in word and deed.\\
Grant this through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\\
who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\

\begin{verse}
Almighty ever-living God,\\
whom, taught by the Holy Spirit,\\
we dare to call our Father,\\
bring, we pray, to perfection in our hearts\\
the spirit of adoption as your sons and daughters,\\
that we may merit to enter into the inheritance\\
which you have promised.\\
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\\
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.
