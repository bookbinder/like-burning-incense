\begin{verse}
O God, who have prepared for those who love you\\
good things which no eye can see,\\
fill our hearts, we pray, with the warmth of your love,\\
so that, loving you in all things and above all things,\\
we may attain your promises,\\
which surpass every human desire.\\
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\\
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.
