Father,\\
help us to seek the values\\
that will bring us lasting joy in this changing world.\\
In our desire for what you promise\\
make us one in mind and heart.\\
Grant this through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\\
who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\

\begin{verse}
O God, who cause the minds of the faithful\\
to unite in a single purpose,\\
grant your people to love what you command\\
and to desire what you promise,\\
that, amid the uncertainties of this world,\\
our hearts may be fixed on that place\\
where true gladness is found.\\
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\\
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.
