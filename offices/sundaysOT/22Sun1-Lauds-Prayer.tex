Almighty God,\\
every good thing comes from you.\\
Fill our hearts with love for you,\\
increase our faith,\\
and by your constant care\\
protect the good you have given us.\\
We ask this through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\\
who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\

\begin{verse}
God of might, giver of every good gift,\\
put into our hearts the love of your name,\\
so that, by deepening our sense of reverence,\\
you may nurture in us what is good\\
and, by your watchful care,\\
keep safe what you have nurtured.\\
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\\
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.
