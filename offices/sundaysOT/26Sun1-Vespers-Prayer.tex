Father,\\
you show your almighty power\\
in your mercy and forgiveness.\\
Continue to fill us with your gifts of love.\\
Help us to hurry toward the eternal life you promise\\
and come to share in the joys of your kingdom.\\
Grant this through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\\
who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\

O God, who manifest your almighty power\\
above all by pardoning and showing mercy,\\
bestow, we pray, your grace abundantly upon us\\
and make those hastening to attain your promises\\

Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\\
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
