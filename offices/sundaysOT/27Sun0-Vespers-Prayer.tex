Father,\\
your love for us\\
surpasses all our hopes and desires.\\
Forgive our failings,\\
keep us in your peace\\
and lead us in the way of salvation.\\
We ask this through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\\
who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\

\begin{prayerverse}
Almighty ever-living God,\\
who in the abundance of your kindness\\
surpass the merits and desires of those who entreat you,\\
pour out your mercy upon us\\
to pardon what conscience dreads\\
and to give what prayer does not dare to ask.\\
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\\
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\\
God, for ever and ever.\\
{\color{red}---\thinspace}Amen.
