    \FirstLetter{M}y heart exults in th\pointup{e} Lord,\Med\\
my horn is exalted in m\pointup{y} God.

I have swallowed up m\pointup{y} enemies;\Med\\
I rejoice in m\pointup{y} victory.\\
There is no Holy One like th\pointup{e} Lord;\Med\\
there is no Rock like \pointup{o}ur God.

Speak boastfully n\pointup{o} longer,\Med\\
nor let arrogance issue from y\pointup{o}ur mouths.\\
For an all-knowing God is th\pointup{e} Lord,\Med\\
a God who judg\pointup{e}s deeds.

The bows of the mighty \pointup{a}re broken,\Med\\
while the tottering gird \pointup{o}n strength.\\
The well-fed hire themselves out f\pointup{o}r bread,\Med\\
while the hungry batten \pointup{o}n spoil.\\
The barren wife bears sev\pointup{e}n sons,\Med\\
while the mother of man\pointup{y} languishes.

The Lord puts to death and gives l\pointup{\i}fe;\Flex\\
he casts down to the neth\pointup{e}r world;\Med\\
he raises up \pointup{a}gain.\\
The Lord makes poor and m\pointup{a}kes rich,\Med\\
he humbles, he also \pointup{e}xalts.

He raises the needy from th\pointup{e} dust;\Med\\
from the ash heap he lifts up th\pointup{e} poor,\\
to seat them w\pointup{\i}th nobles\Med\\
and make a glorious throne th\pointup{e}ir heritage.

For the pillars of the earth are th\pointup{e} Lord’s,\Med\\
and he has set the world \pointup{u}pon them.\\
He will guard the footsteps of h\pointup{\i}s faithful ones,\Med\\
but the wicked shall perish in th\pointup{e} darkness.\\
For not by strength does man pr\pointup{e}vail;\Med\\
the Lord’s foes shall b\pointup{e} shattered.

The Most High in heav\pointup{e}n thunders;\Med\\
the Lord judges the ends of th\pointup{e} earth.\\
Now may he give strength to h\pointup{\i}s king\Med\\
and exalt the horn of his \pointup{a}nointed!

Glory to the Father and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginning, \pointup{\i}s now,\Med\\
and will be forever. \pointupl{A}men.
