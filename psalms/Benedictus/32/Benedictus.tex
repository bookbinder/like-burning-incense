\FirstLetter{B}lessed be the Lord, the God \pointup{o}f Israel;\Med\\
he has come to his people and set them fr\pointup{e}e.\\
He has raised up for us a might\pointup{y} savior,\Med\\
born of the house of his servant D\pointup{a}vid.

Through his holy prophets he promised of \pointup{o}ld\Flex\\
that he would save us from \pointup{o}ur enemies,\Med\\
from the hands of all who h\pointup{a}te us.\\
He promised to show mercy to \pointup{o}ur fathers\Med\\
and to remember his holy c\pointup{o}venant.

This was the oath he swore to our fath\pointup{e}r Abraham:\Med\\
to set us free from the hands of our \pointup{e}nemies,\\
free to worship him with\pointup{o}ut fear,\Med\\
holy and righteous in his sight all the days of our l\pointup{\i}fe.

You, my child, shall be called the prophet of the M\pointup{o}st High;\Med\\
for you will go before the Lord to prepare his w\pointup{a}y,\\
to give his people knowledge of s\pointup{a}lvation\Med\\
by the forgiveness of their s\pointup{\i}ns.

In the tender compassion of \pointup{o}ur God\Med\\
the dawn from on high shall break up\pointup{o}n us,\\
to shine on those who dwell in darkness and the shadow \pointup{o}f death,\Med\\
and to guide our feet into the way of p\pointup{e}ace.

Glory to the Father, and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
and to the Holy Sp\pointup{\i}rit:\\
as it was in the beginning, \pointup{\i}s now,\Med\\
and will be for ever. Am\pointup{e}n.
