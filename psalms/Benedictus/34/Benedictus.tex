\FirstLetter{B}lessed be the Lord, the God of \pointup{I}srael;\Med\\
he has come to his people and s\pointup{e}t them free.\\
He has raised up for us a mighty s\pointup{a}vior,\Med\\
born of the house of his s\pointup{e}rvant David.

Through his holy prophets he promised of \pointup{o}ld\Flex\\
that he would save us from our \pointup{e}nemies,\Med\\
from the hands of \pointup{a}ll who hate us.\\
He promised to show mercy to our f\pointup{a}thers\Med\\
and to remember his h\pointup{o}ly covenant.

This was the oath he swore to our father \pointupl{A}braham:\Med\\
to set us free from the hands \pointup{o}f our enemies,\\
free to worship him with\pointup{o}ut fear,\Med\\
holy and righteous in his sight all the days \pointup{o}f our life. 

You, my child, shall be called the prophet of the M\pointup{o}st High;\Med\\
for you will go before the Lord to prep\pointup{a}re his way,\\
to give his people knowledge of salv\pointup{a}tion\Med\\
by the forgiveness \pointup{o}f their sins.

In the tender compassion of \pointup{o}ur God\Med\\
the dawn from on high shall br\pointup{e}ak upon us,\\
to shine on those who dwell in darkness and the shadow \pointup{o}f death,\Med\\
and to guide our feet into the w\pointup{a}y of peace.

Glory to the Father, and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
and to the H\pointup{o}ly Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginning, \pointup{\i}s now,\Med\\
and will be for ev\pointup{e}r. Amen.
