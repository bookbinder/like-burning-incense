\FirstLetter{B}lessed be the Lord, the G\pointup{o}d of Israel;\Med\\
he has come to his people and set them fr\pointup{e}e.\\
He has raised up for us a m\pointup{\i}ghty savior,\Med\\
born of the house of his servant D\pointup{a}vid.

Through his holy prophets he promised of \pointup{o}ld\Flex\\
that he would save us fr\pointup{o}m our enemies,\Med\\
from the hands of all who h\pointup{a}te us.\\
He promised to show mercy t\pointup{o} our fathers\Med\\
and to remember his holy c\pointup{o}venant.

This was the oath he swore to our f\pointup{a}ther Abraham:\Med\\
to set us free from the hands of our \pointup{e}nemies,\\
free to worship him w\pointup{\i}thout fear,\Med\\
holy and righteous in his sight all the days of our l\pointup{\i}fe.

You, my child, shall be called the prophet of th\pointup{e} Most High;\Med\\
for you will go before the Lord to prepare his w\pointup{a}y,\\
to give his people knowledge \pointup{o}f salvation\Med\\
by the forgiveness of their s\pointup{\i}ns.

In the tender compassion \pointup{o}f our God\Med\\
the dawn from on high shall break up\pointup{o}n us,\\
to shine on those who dwell in darkness and the shad\pointup{o}w of death,\Med\\
and to guide our feet into the way of p\pointup{e}ace.

Glory to the Father, and t\pointup{o} the Son,\Med\\
and to the Holy Sp\pointup{\i}rit:\\
as it was in the beginn\pointup{\i}ng, is now,\Med\\
and will be for ever. Am\pointup{e}n.
