\FirstLetter{B}lessed be the Lord, the G\pointup{o}d of Israel;\Med\\
he has come to his people and set th\pointup{e}m free.\\
He has raised up for us a m\pointup{\i}ghty savior,\Med\\
born of the house of his serv\pointup{a}nt David.

Through his holy prophets he promised of \pointup{o}ld\Flex\\
that he would save us fr\pointup{o}m our enemies,\Med\\
from the hands of all wh\pointup{o} hate us.\\
He promised to show mercy t\pointup{o} our fathers\Med\\
and to remember his hol\pointup{y} covenant.

This was the oath he swore to our f\pointup{a}ther Abraham:\Med\\
to set us free from the hands of \pointup{o}ur enemies,\\
free to worship him without f\pointup{e}ar,\Flex\\
holy and righteous \pointup{\i}n his sight\Med\\
all the days of \pointup{o}ur life.

You, my child, shall be called the prophet of th\pointup{e} Most High;\Med\\
for you will go before the Lord to prepare h\pointup{\i}s way,\\
to give his people knowledge \pointup{o}f salvation\Med\\
by the forgiveness of th\pointup{e}ir sins.

In the tender compassion \pointup{o}f our God\Med\\
the dawn from on high shall break \pointup{u}pon us,\\
to shine on those who dwell in darkness and the shad\pointup{o}w of death,\Med\\
and to guide our feet into the way \pointup{o}f peace.

Glory to the Father, and t\pointup{o} the Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginn\pointup{\i}ng, is now,\Med\\
and will be for ever. \pointupl{A}men.
