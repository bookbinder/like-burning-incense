\FirstLetter{L}et us give thanks to the F\pointup{a}ther\Flex\\
for having m\pointup{a}de you worthy\Med\\
to share the lot of the saints \pointup{\i}n light.

He rescued us from the pow\pointup{e}r of darkness\Med\\
and brought us into the kingdom of his belov\pointup{e}d Son.\\
Through him we h\pointup{a}ve redemption,\Med\\
the forgiveness of \pointup{o}ur sins.

He is the image of the invis\pointup{\i}ble God,\Med\\
the first-born of \pointup{a}ll creatures.\\
In him everything in heaven and on earth w\pointup{a}s created,\Med\\
things visible and \pointup{\i}nvisible.

All were creat\pointup{e}d through him;\Med\\
all were created f\pointup{o}r him.\\
He is before all \pointup{e}lse that is.\Med\\
In him everything continues \pointup{\i}n being.

It is he who is head of the bod\pointup{y}, the church!\Med\\
he who is the b\pointup{e}ginning,\\
the first-born \pointup{o}f the dead,\Med\\
so that primacy may be his \pointup{\i}n everything.

It pleased God to make absolute fullness res\pointup{\i}de in him\Med\\
and, by means of him, to reconcile everything in h\pointup{\i}s person,\\
both on earth and \pointup{\i}n the heavens,\Med\\
making peace through the blood of h\pointup{\i}s cross.

Glory to the Father and t\pointup{o} the Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginn\pointup{\i}ng, is now,\Med\\
and will be forever. \pointupl{A}men.
