\FirstLetter{P}raised be the God \pointup{a}nd Father\Med\\
of our Lord Jesus Chr\pointup{\i}st,\\
who has bestowed on us \pointup{\i}n Christ\Med\\
every spiritual blessing in the h\pointup{e}avens.

God chose us in h\pointup{\i}m\Flex\\
before the world b\pointup{e}gan\Med\\
to be holy and blameless in his s\pointup{\i}ght.

He predest\pointup{\i}ned us\Med\\
to be his adopted sons through Jesus Chr\pointup{\i}st,\\
such was his will and pleas\pointup{u}re,\Flex\\
that all might praise the glori\pointup{o}us favor\Med\\
he has bestowed on us in his bel\pointup{o}ved.

In him and through his blood, we have been r\pointup{e}deemed,\Med\\
and our sins forg\pointup{\i}ven,\\
so immeasurabl\pointup{y} generous\Med\\
is Godâ€™s favor to \pointup{u}s.

God has given us th\pointup{e} wisdom\Med\\
to understand fully the m\pointup{y}stery,\\
the plan he w\pointup{a}s pleased\Med\\
to decree in Chr\pointup{\i}st.

A plan to be carr\pointup{\i}ed out\Med\\
in Christ, in the fullness of t\pointup{\i}me,\\
to bring all things into one \pointup{\i}n him,\Med\\
in the heavens and on \pointup{e}arth.

Glory to the Father and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
and to the Holy Sp\pointup{\i}rit:\\
as it was in the beginning, \pointup{\i}s now,\Med\\
and will be forever. Am\pointup{e}n.
