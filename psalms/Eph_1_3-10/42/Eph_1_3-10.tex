    \FirstLetter{P}raised be the G\pointup{o}d and Father\Med\\
    of our Lord Jesus Chr\pointup{\i}st,\\
    who has bestowed on \pointup{u}s in Christ\Med\\
    every spiritual blessing in the h\pointup{e}avens.
    
    God chose us in h\pointup{\i}m\Flex\\
    before the w\pointup{o}rld began\Med\\
    to be holy and blameless in his s\pointup{\i}ght.
    
    He pred\pointup{e}stined us\Med\\
    to be his adopted sons through Jesus Chr\pointup{\i}st,\Med\\
    such was his will and pleas\pointup{u}re,\Flex\\
    that all might praise the gl\pointup{o}rious favor\Med\\
    he has bestowed on us in his bel\pointup{o}ved.
    
    In him and through his blood, we have b\pointup{e}en redeemed,\Med\\
    and our sins forg\pointup{\i}ven,\\
    so immeasurably g\pointup{e}nerous\Med\\
    is Godâ€™s favor to \pointup{u}s.
    
    God has given \pointup{u}s the wisdom\Med\\
    to understand fully the m\pointup{y}stery,\\
    the plan h\pointup{e} was pleased\Med\\
    to decree in Chr\pointup{\i}st.
    
    A plan to be c\pointup{a}rried out\Med\\
    in Christ, in the fullness of t\pointup{\i}me,\\
    to bring all things into \pointup{o}ne in him,\Med\\
    in the heavens and on \pointup{e}arth.
    
    Glory to the Father and t\pointup{o} the Son,\Med\\
    and to the Holy Sp\pointup{\i}rit:\\
    as it was in the beginn\pointup{\i}ng, is now,\Med\\
    and will be forever. Am\pointup{e}n.
