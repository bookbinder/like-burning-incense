\FirstLetter{P}raised be the G\pointup{o}d and Father\Med\\
of our Lord Jes\pointup{u}s Christ,\\
who has bestowed on \pointup{u}s in Christ\Med\\
every spiritual blessing in th\pointup{e} heavens.

God chose us in h\pointup{\i}m\Flex\\
before the w\pointup{o}rld began\Med\\
to be holy and blameless in h\pointup{\i}s sight.

He pred\pointup{e}stined us\Med\\
to be his adopted sons through Jes\pointup{u}s Christ,\Med\\
such was his will and pleas\pointup{u}re,\Flex\\
that all might praise the gl\pointup{o}rious favor\Med\\
he has bestowed on us in his b\pointup{e}loved.

In him and through his blood, we have b\pointup{e}en redeemed,\Med\\
and our sins f\pointup{o}rgiven,\\
so immeasurably g\pointup{e}nerous\Med\\
is Godâ€™s favor t\pointup{o} us.

God has given \pointup{u}s the wisdom\Med\\
to understand fully th\pointup{e} mystery,\\
the plan h\pointup{e} was pleased\Med\\
to decree \pointup{\i}n Christ.

A plan to be c\pointup{a}rried out\Med\\
in Christ, in the fullness \pointup{o}f time,\\
to bring all things into \pointup{o}ne in him,\Med\\
in the heavens and \pointup{o}n earth.

Glory to the Father and t\pointup{o} the Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginn\pointup{\i}ng, is now,\Med\\
and will be forever. \pointupl{A}men.
