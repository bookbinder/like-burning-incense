\FirstLetter{O} Lord, I have heard y\pointup{o}ur renown,\Med\\
and feared, O Lord, your w\pointup{o}rk.\\
In the course of the years revive \pointup{\i}t,\Flex\\
in the course of the years m\pointup{a}ke it known;\Med\\
in your wrath remember comp\pointup{a}ssion!

God c\pointup{o}mes from Teman,\Med\\
the Holy One from Mount P\pointup{a}ran.\\
Covered are the heavens w\pointup{\i}th his glory,\Med\\
and with his praise the earth is f\pointup{\i}lled.

His splendor spreads like the l\pointup{\i}ght;\Flex\\
rays shine forth fr\pointup{o}m beside him,\Med\\
where his power is conc\pointup{e}aled.\\
You come forth to s\pointup{a}ve your people,\Med\\
to save your an\pointup{o}inted one.

You tread the sea w\pointup{\i}th your steeds\Med\\
amid the churning of the deep w\pointup{a}ters.\\
I hear, and my b\pointup{o}dy trembles;\Med\\
at the sound, my lips q\pointup{u}iver.

Decay inv\pointup{a}des my bones,\Med\\
my legs tremble ben\pointup{e}ath me.\\
I await the day \pointup{o}f distress\Med\\
that will come upon the people who att\pointup{a}ck us.

For though the fig tree bl\pointup{o}ssom not\Med\\
nor fruit be on the v\pointup{\i}nes,\\
though the yield of the \pointup{o}live fail\Med\\
and the terraces produce no n\pointup{o}urishment,

though the flocks disappear fr\pointup{o}m the fold\Med\\
and there be no herd in the st\pointup{a}lls,\\
yet will I rejoice \pointup{\i}n the Lord\Med\\
and exult in my saving G\pointup{o}d.

God, my Lord, is my str\pointup{e}ngth;\Flex\\
he makes my feet swift as th\pointup{o}se of hinds\Med\\
and enables me to go upon the h\pointup{e}ights.

Glory to the Father and t\pointup{o} the Son,\Med\\
and to the Holy Sp\pointup{\i}rit:\\
as it was in the beginn\pointup{\i}ng, is now,\Med\\
and will be forever. Am\pointup{e}n.
