\FirstLetter{I}n days t\pointup{o} come,\Med\\
the mountain of the L\pointup{o}rd’s house\\
shall be established as the high\pointup{e}st mountain\Med\\
and raised above th\pointup{e} hills.

All nations shall stream t\pointup{o}ward it;\Med\\
many peoples shall come \pointup{a}nd say:\\
“Come, let us climb the Lord’s m\pointup{o}untain,\Med\\
to the house of the God \pointup{o}f Jacob,\\
That he may instruct us in h\pointup{\i}s ways, \Med\\
and we may walk in h\pointup{\i}s paths.”

For from Zion shall go forth instr\pointup{u}ction,\Med\\
and the word of the Lord from J\pointup{e}rusalem.

He shall judge between the n\pointup{a}tions,\Med\\
and impose terms on man\pointup{y} peoples.\\
They shall beat their swords into pl\pointup{o}wshares\Med\\
and their spears into prun\pointup{\i}ng hooks;\\
One nation shall not raise the sword against an\pointup{o}ther,\Med\\
nor shall they train for war \pointup{a}gain.

O house of Jac\pointup{o}b, come,\Med\\
let us walk in the light of th\pointup{e} Lord!

Glory to the Father and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
    and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginning, \pointup{\i}s now,\Med\\
    and will be for ever. \pointupl{A}men.
