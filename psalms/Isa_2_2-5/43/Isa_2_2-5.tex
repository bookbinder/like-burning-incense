\FirstLetter{I}n d\pointup{a}ys to come,\Med\\
the mountain of the L\pointup{o}rd’s house\\
shall be established as the h\pointup{\i}ghest mountain\Med\\
and raised above th\pointup{e} hills.

All nations sh\pointup{a}ll stream toward it;\Med\\
many peoples shall come \pointup{a}nd say:\\
“Come, let us climb th\pointup{e} Lord’s mountain,\Med\\
to the house of the God \pointup{o}f Jacob,\\
That he may instruct us \pointup{\i}n his ways, \Med\\
and we may walk in h\pointup{\i}s paths.”

For from Zion shall go f\pointup{o}rth instruction,\Med\\
and the word of the Lord from J\pointup{e}rusalem.

He shall judge betw\pointup{e}en the nations,\Med\\
and impose terms on man\pointup{y} peoples.\\
They shall beat their swords \pointup{\i}nto plowshares\Med\\
and their spears into prun\pointup{\i}ng hooks;\\
One nation shall not raise the sword ag\pointup{a}inst another,\Med\\
nor shall they train for war \pointup{a}gain.

O house of J\pointup{a}cob, come,\Med\\
let us walk in the light of th\pointup{e} Lord!

Glory to the Father and t\pointup{o} the Son,\Med\\
    and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginn\pointup{\i}ng, is now,\Med\\
    and will be for ever. \pointupl{A}men.
