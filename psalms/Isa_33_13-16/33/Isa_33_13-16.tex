Hear, you who are f\pointup{a}r off,\Med\\
what I h\pointup{a}ve done;\\
you who \pointup{a}re near,\Med\\
acknowledge m\pointup{y} might.

On Zion sinners are \pointup{\i}n dread,\Med\\
trembling grips th\pointup{e} impious;\\
“Who of us can live with the consum\pointup{\i}ng fire?\Med\\
Who of us can live with the everlast\pointup{\i}ng flames?”

He who practices virtue and sp\pointup{e}aks honestly,\Med\\
who spurns what is gained by \pointup{o}ppression,\\
brushing h\pointup{\i}s hands\Med\\
free of contact with \pointup{a} bribe,\\
stopping his ears lest he hear \pointup{o}f bloodshed,\Med\\
closing his eyes lest he look \pointup{o}n evil.

He shall dwell on th\pointup{e} heights,\Med\\
his stronghold shall be the rock\pointup{y} fastness,\\
his food \pointup{a}nd drink\Med\\
in steady s\pointup{u}pply.

Glory to the Father and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginning, \pointup{\i}s now,\Med\\
and will be forever. \pointupl{A}men.
