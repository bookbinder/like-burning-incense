\FirstLetter{H}ear, you who \pointup{a}re far off,\Med\\
what I h\pointup{a}ve done;\\
you wh\pointup{o} are near,\Med\\
acknowledge m\pointup{y} might.

On Zion sinners \pointup{a}re in dread,\Med\\
trembling grips th\pointup{e} impious;\\
“Who of us can live with the cons\pointup{u}ming fire?\Med\\
Who of us can live with the everlast\pointup{\i}ng flames?”

He who practices virtue \pointup{a}nd speaks honestly,\Med\\
who spurns what is gained by \pointup{o}ppression,\\
brush\pointup{\i}ng his hands\Med\\
free of contact with \pointup{a} bribe,\\
stopping his ears lest he h\pointup{e}ar of bloodshed,\Med\\
closing his eyes lest he look \pointup{o}n evil.

He shall dwell \pointup{o}n the heights,\Med\\
his stronghold shall be the rock\pointup{y} fastness,\\
his f\pointup{o}od and drink\Med\\
in steady s\pointup{u}pply.

Glory to the Father and t\pointup{o} the Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginn\pointup{\i}ng, is now,\Med\\
and will be forever. \pointupl{A}men.
