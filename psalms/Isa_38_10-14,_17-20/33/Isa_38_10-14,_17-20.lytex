    \FirstLetter{O}nce \pointup{I} said,\Med\\
“In the noontime of life I must d\pointup{e}part!\\
To the gates of the nether world I shall be c\pointup{o}n\-signed\Med\\
for the rest of m\pointup{y} years.”

I said, “I shall see the Lord n\pointup{o} more\Med\\
in the land of th\pointup{e} living.\\
No longer shall I behold my fell\pointup{o}w men\Med\\
among those who dwell in th\pointup{e} world.”

My dwelling, like a sheph\pointup{e}rd’s tent,\Med\\
is struck down and borne away fr\pointup{o}m me;\\
you have folded up my life, like \pointup{a} weaver\Med\\
who severs the l\pointup{a}st thread.

Day and night you give me over t\pointup{o} torment;\Med\\
I cry out until th\pointup{e} dawn.\\
Like a lion he breaks all m\pointup{y} bones;\Med\\
day and night you give me over t\pointup{o} torment.

Like a swallow I utter shr\pointup{\i}ll cries;\Med\\
I moan like \pointup{a} dove.\\
My eyes grow weak, gaz\pointup{\i}ng heaven-ward:\Med\\
O Lord, I am in straits; be m\pointup{y} surety!

You have preserved m\pointup{y} life\Med\\
from the pit of d\pointup{e}struction,\\
when you cast behind y\pointup{o}ur back\Med\\
all m\pointup{y} sins.

For it is not the nether world that gives y\pointup{o}u thanks,\Med\\
nor death that prais\pointup{e}s you;\\
Neither do those who go down into th\pointup{e} pit\Med\\
await y\pointup{o}ur kindness.

The living, the living give y\pointup{o}u thanks,\Med\\
as I do t\pointup{o}day.\\
Fathers declare to th\pointup{e}ir sons,\Med\\
O God, your faithf\pointup{u}lness.

The Lord is \pointup{o}ur savior;\Med\\
we shall sing to str\pointup{\i}nged instruments\\
in the house \pointup{o}f the Lord\Med\\
all the days of \pointup{o}ur life.

Glory to the Father and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginning, \pointup{\i}s now,\Med\\
and will be forever. \pointupl{A}men.
