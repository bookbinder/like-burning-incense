\FirstLetter{S}ing to the Lord a n\pointup{e}w song,\Med\\
his praise from the end of th\pointup{e} earth:

Let the sea and what fills it r\pointup{e}sound,\Med\\
the coastlands, and those who dwell \pointup{\i}n them.\\
Let the steppe and its cities cr\pointup{y} out,\Med\\
the villages where Ked\pointup{a}r dwells;

Let the inhabitants of Sela \pointup{e}xult,\Med\\
and shout from the top of th\pointup{e} mountains.\\
Let them give glory to th\pointup{e} Lord,\Med\\
and utter his praise in th\pointup{e} coastlands.

The Lord goes forth like \pointup{a} hero,\Med\\
like a warrior he stirs up h\pointup{\i}s ardor;\\
he shouts out his battl\pointup{e} cry,\Med\\
against his enemies he shows h\pointup{\i}s might:

I have looked away, and k\pointup{e}pt silence,\Med\\
I have said nothing, holding mys\pointup{e}lf in;\\
but now, I cry out as a woman \pointup{\i}n labor,\Med\\
gasping \pointup{a}nd panting.

I will lay waste mountains \pointup{a}nd hills,\Med\\
all their herbage I will dr\pointup{y} up;\\
I will turn the rivers int\pointup{o} marshes,\Med\\
and the marshes I will dr\pointup{y} up.

I will lead the blind on th\pointup{e}ir journey;\Med\\
by paths unknown I w\pointup{\i}ll guide them.\\
I will turn darkness into light b\pointup{e}fore them,\Med\\
and make crooked w\pointup{a}ys straight.

Glory to the Father and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
    and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginning, \pointup{\i}s now,\Med\\
    and will be for ever. \pointupl{A}men.
