\FirstLetter{S}ing to the Lord \pointup{a} new song,\Med\\
his praise from the end of th\pointup{e} earth:

Let the sea and what fills \pointup{\i}t resound,\Med\\
the coastlands, and those who dwell \pointup{\i}n them.\\
Let the steppe and its cit\pointup{\i}es cry out,\Med\\
the villages where Ked\pointup{a}r dwells;

Let the inhabitants of Sel\pointup{a} exult,\Med\\
and shout from the top of th\pointup{e} mountains.\\
Let them give glory t\pointup{o} the Lord,\Med\\
and utter his praise in th\pointup{e} coastlands.

The Lord goes forth l\pointup{\i}ke a hero,\Med\\
like a warrior he stirs up h\pointup{\i}s ardor;\\
he shouts out his b\pointup{a}ttle cry,\Med\\
against his enemies he shows h\pointup{\i}s might:

I have looked away, \pointup{a}nd kept silence,\Med\\
I have said nothing, holding mys\pointup{e}lf in;\\
but now, I cry out as a wom\pointup{a}n in labor,\Med\\
gasping \pointup{a}nd panting.

I will lay waste mount\pointup{a}ins and hills,\Med\\
all their herbage I will dr\pointup{y} up;\\
I will turn the rivers \pointup{\i}nto marshes,\Med\\
and the marshes I will dr\pointup{y} up.

I will lead the blind \pointup{o}n their journey;\Med\\
by paths unknown I w\pointup{\i}ll guide them.\\
I will turn darkness into l\pointup{\i}ght before them,\Med\\
and make crooked w\pointup{a}ys straight.

Glory to the Father and t\pointup{o} the Son,\Med\\
    and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginn\pointup{\i}ng, is now,\Med\\
    and will be for ever. \pointupl{A}men.
