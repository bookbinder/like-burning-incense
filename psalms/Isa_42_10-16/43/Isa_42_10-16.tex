\FirstLetter{S}ing to the Lord \pointup{a} new song,\Med\\
his praise from the \pointup{e}nd of the earth:

Let the sea and what fills \pointup{\i}t resound,\Med\\
the coastlands, and those who dw\pointup{e}ll in them.\\
Let the steppe and its cit\pointup{\i}es cry out,\Med\\
the villages where K\pointup{e}dar dwells;

Let the inhabitants of Sel\pointup{a} exult,\Med\\
and shout from the t\pointup{o}p of the mountains.\\
Let them give glory t\pointup{o} the Lord,\Med\\
and utter his pr\pointup{a}ise in the coastlands.

The Lord goes forth l\pointup{\i}ke a hero,\Med\\
like a warrior he st\pointup{\i}rs up his ardor;\\
he shouts out his b\pointup{a}ttle cry,\Med\\
against his enemies he sh\pointup{o}ws his might:

I have looked away, \pointup{a}nd kept silence,\Med\\
I have said nothing, holding m\pointup{y}self in;\\
but now, I cry out as a wom\pointup{a}n in labor,\Med\\
gasp\pointup{\i}ng and panting.

I will lay waste mount\pointup{a}ins and hills,\Med\\
all their herbage I w\pointup{\i}ll dry up;\\
I will turn the rivers \pointup{\i}nto marshes,\Med\\
and the marshes I w\pointup{\i}ll dry up.

I will lead the blind \pointup{o}n their journey;\Med\\
by paths unknown \pointup{I} will guide them.\\
I will turn darkness into l\pointup{\i}ght before them,\Med\\
and make cr\pointup{o}oked ways straight.

Glory to the Father and t\pointup{o} the Son,\Med\\
    and to the H\pointup{o}ly Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginn\pointup{\i}ng, is now,\Med\\
    and will be for \pointup{e}ver. Amen.
