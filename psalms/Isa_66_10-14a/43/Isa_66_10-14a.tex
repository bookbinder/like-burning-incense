\FirstLetter{R}ejoice with Jerusalem and be glad bec\pointup{a}use of her,\Med\\
all you wh\pointup{o} love her;\\
exult, ex\pointup{u}lt with her,\Med\\
all you who were mourning ov\pointup{e}r her!

Oh, that you m\pointup{a}y suck fully\Med\\
of the milk of h\pointup{e}r comfort,\\
that you may nurse w\pointup{i}th delight\Med\\
at her abund\pointup{a}nt breasts!

For thus says the L\pointup{o}rd:\Flex\\
Lo, I will spread prosperity over her l\pointup{i}ke a river,\Med\\
and the wealth of the nations like an overflow\pointup{\i}ng torrent.

As nurslings, you shall be carried \pointup{i}n her arms,\Med\\
and fondled in h\pointup{e}r lap;\\
as a mother comforts her s\pointup{o}n,\Flex\\
so will I c\pointup{o}mfort you;\Med\\
in Jerusalem you shall find y\pointup{o}ur comfort.

When you see this, your heart sh\pointup{a}ll rejoice,\Med\\
and your bodies flourish like th\pointup{e} grass.

Glory to the Father and t\pointup{o} the Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginn\pointup{i}ng, is now,\Med\\
and will be for ever. \pointupl{A}men.
