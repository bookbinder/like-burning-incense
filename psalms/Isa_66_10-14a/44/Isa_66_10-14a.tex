\FirstLetter{R}ejoice with Jerusalem and be glad bec\pointup{a}use of her,\Med\\
all y\pointup{o}u who love her;\\
exult, ex\pointup{u}lt with her,\Med\\
all you who were mourning \pointup{o}ver her!

Oh, that you m\pointup{a}y suck fully\Med\\
of the milk \pointup{o}f her comfort,\\
that you may nurse w\pointup{\i}th delight\Med\\
at her ab\pointup{u}ndant breasts!

For thus says the L\pointup{o}rd:\Flex\\
Lo, I will spread prosperity over her l\pointup{\i}ke a river,\Med\\
and the wealth of the nations like an overfl\pointup{o}wing torrent.

As nurslings, you shall be carried \pointup{\i}n her arms,\Med\\
and fondled \pointup{\i}n her lap;\\
as a mother comforts her s\pointup{o}n,\Flex\\
so will I c\pointup{o}mfort you;\Med\\
in Jerusalem you shall f\pointup{\i}nd your comfort.

When you see this, your heart sh\pointup{a}ll rejoice,\Med\\
and your bodies flourish l\pointup{\i}ke the grass.

Glory to the Father and t\pointup{o} the Son,\Med\\
and to the H\pointup{o}ly Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginn\pointup{\i}ng, is now,\Med\\
and will be for ev\pointup{e}r. Amen.
