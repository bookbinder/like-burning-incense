\FirstLetter{L}et my eyes str\pointup{e}am with tears\Med\\
day and night, w\pointup{\i}thout rest,\\
over the great destruction which overwh\pointup{e}lms\Flex\\
the virgin daughter \pointup{o}f my people,\Med\\
over her inc\pointup{u}rable wound.

If I walk out int\pointup{o} the field,\Med\\
look! those sl\pointup{a}in by the sword;\\
If I ent\pointup{e}r the city,\Med\\
look! those cons\pointup{u}med by hunger.\\
Even the prophet \pointup{a}nd the priest\Med\\
forage in a l\pointup{a}nd they know not.

Have you cast Judah \pointup{o}ff completely?\Med\\
Is Zion l\pointup{o}athsome to you?\\
Why have you struck \pointup{u}s a blow\Med\\
that cann\pointup{o}t be healed?

We wait for peace, to n\pointup{o} avail;\Med\\
for a time of healing, but terror c\pointup{o}mes instead.\\
We recognize, O Lord, our wickedn\pointup{e}ss,\Flex\\
the guilt \pointup{o}f our fathers;\Med\\
that we have s\pointup{\i}nned against you.

For your nameâ€™s sake spurn us n\pointup{o}t,\Flex\\
disgrace not the throne \pointup{o}f your glory;\Med\\
remember your covenant with us, and br\pointup{e}ak it not.

Glory to the Father and t\pointup{o} the Son,\Med\\
and to the H\pointup{o}ly Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginn\pointup{\i}ng, is now,\Med\\
and will be for\pointup{e}ver. Amen.
