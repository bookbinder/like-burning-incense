\FirstLetter{L}et my eyes str\pointup{e}am with tears\Med\\
day and night, with\pointup{o}ut rest,\\
over the great destruction which overwh\pointup{e}lms\Flex\\
the virgin daughter \pointup{o}f my people,\Med\\
over her incurabl\pointup{e} wound.

If I walk out int\pointup{o} the field,\Med\\
look! those slain by th\pointup{e} sword;\\
If I ent\pointup{e}r the city,\Med\\
look! those consumed b\pointup{y} hunger.\\
Even the prophet \pointup{a}nd the priest\Med\\
forage in a land they kn\pointup{o}w not.

Have you cast Judah \pointup{o}ff completely?\Med\\
Is Zion loathsome t\pointup{o} you?\\
Why have you struck \pointup{u}s a blow\Med\\
that cannot b\pointup{e} healed?

We wait for peace, to n\pointup{o} avail;\Med\\
for a time of healing, but terror comes \pointup{\i}nstead.\\
We recognize, O Lord, our wickedn\pointup{e}ss,\Flex\\
the guilt \pointup{o}f our fathers;\Med\\
that we have sinned \pointup{a}gainst you.

For your nameâ€™s sake spurn us n\pointup{o}t,\Flex\\
disgrace not the throne \pointup{o}f your glory;\Med\\
remember your covenant with us, and break \pointup{\i}t not.

Glory to the Father and t\pointup{o} the Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginn\pointup{i}ng, is now,\Med\\
and will be forever. \pointupl{A}men.
