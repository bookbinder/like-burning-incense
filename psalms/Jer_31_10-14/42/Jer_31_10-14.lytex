    \FirstLetter{H}ear the word of the L\pointup{o}rd, O nations,\Med\\
proclaim it on distant coasts and s\pointup{a}y:\\
He who scattered Israel, now gathers th\pointup{e}m together,\Med\\
he guards them as a shepherd his fl\pointup{o}ck.

The Lord shall r\pointup{a}nsom Jacob,\Med\\
he shall redeem him from the hand of his c\pointup{o}nqueror.

Shouting, they shall mount the h\pointup{e}ights of Zion,\Med\\
they shall come streaming to the Lordâ€™s bl\pointup{e}ssings:\\
the grain, the wine, \pointup{a}nd the oil,\Med\\
the sheep and the \pointup{o}xen;\\
they themselves shall be like w\pointup{a}tered gardens,\Med\\
never again shall they l\pointup{a}nguish.

Then the virgins shall make merr\pointup{y} and dance,\Med\\
and young men and old as w\pointup{e}ll.\\
I will turn their mourning \pointup{\i}nto joy,\Med\\
I will console and gladden them after their s\pointup{o}rrows.\\
I will lavish choice portions up\pointup{o}n the priests,\Med\\
and my people shall be filled with my blessings, says the L\pointup{o}rd.

Glory to the Father and t\pointup{o} the Son,\Med\\
and to the Holy Sp\pointup{\i}rit:\\
as it was in the beginn\pointup{\i}ng, is now,\Med\\
and will be forever. Am\pointup{e}n.
