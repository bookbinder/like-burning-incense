Canticle â€“ Judith 16:2-3a, 13-15
God who created the world takes care of his people
They were singing a new song (Revelation 5:9).

Strike up the instruments,
a song to my God with timbrels,
chant to the Lord with cymbals.
Sing to him a new song,
exalt and acclaim his name.

A new hymn I will sing to my God.
O Lord, great are you and glorious,
wonderful in power and unsurpassable.

Let your every creature serve you;
for you spoke, and they were made,
you sent forth your spirit, and they were created;
no one can resist your word.

The mountains to their bases, and the seas are shaken;
the rocks, like wax, melt before your glance.
But to those who fear you,
you are very merciful.

Glory to the Father and to the Son,
and to the Holy Spirit:
as it was in the beginning, is now,
and will be forever. Amen.
