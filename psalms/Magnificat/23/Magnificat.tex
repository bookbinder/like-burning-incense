\FirstLetter{M}y soul proclaims the greatness of the L\pointup{o}rd,\Flex\\
my spirit rejoices in God my S\pointup{a}vior\Med\\
for he has looked with favor on his lowl\pointup{y} servant.

From this day all generations will call me bl\pointup{e}ssed:\Flex\\
the Almighty has done great things for m\pointup{e},\Med\\
and holy is h\pointup{\i}s Name.

He has mercy on those who f\pointup{e}ar him\Med\\
in every gen\pointup{e}ration.

He has shown the strength of his \pointup{a}rm,\Med\\
he has scattered the proud in their c\pointup{o}nceit.

He has cast down the mighty from their thr\pointup{o}nes,\Med\\
and has lifted up th\pointup{e} lowly.

He has filled the hungry with good th\pointup{i}ngs,\Med\\
and the rich he has sent aw\pointup{a}y empty.

He has come to the help of his servant \pointup{I}srael\Med\\
for he has remembered his promise \pointup{o}f mercy,\\
the promise he made to our f\pointup{a}thers,\Med\\
to Abraham and his children f\pointup{o}r ever.

Glory to the Father, and to the S\pointup{o}n,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginning, is n\pointup{o}w,\Med\\
and will be for ever. \pointupl{A}men.
