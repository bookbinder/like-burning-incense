\FirstLetter{M}y soul proclaims the greatness of the L\pointup{o}rd,\Flex\\
my spirit rejoices in God m\pointup{y} Savior\Med\\
for he has looked with favor on his lowly s\pointup{e}rvant.

From this day all generations will call me bl\pointup{e}ssed:\Flex\\
the Almighty has done great things f\pointup{o}r me,\Med\\
and holy is his N\pointup{a}me.

He has mercy on those wh\pointup{o} fear him\Med\\
in every gener\pointup{a}tion.

He has shown the strength of h\pointup{\i}s arm,\Med\\
he has scattered the proud in their conc\pointup{e}it.

He has cast down the mighty from th\pointup{e}ir thrones,\Med\\
and has lifted up the l\pointup{o}wly.

He has filled the hungry with g\pointup{o}od things,\Med\\
and the rich he has sent away \pointup{e}mpty.

He has come to the help of his serv\pointup{a}nt Israel\Med\\
for he has remembered his promise of m\pointup{e}rcy,\\
the promise he made to \pointup{o}ur fathers,\Med\\
to Abraham and his children for \pointup{e}ver.

Glory to the Father, and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
and to the Holy Sp\pointup{\i}rit:\\
as it was in the beginning, \pointup{\i}s now,\Med\\
and will be for ever. Am\pointup{e}n.
