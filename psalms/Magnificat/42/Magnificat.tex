\FirstLetter{M}y soul proclaims the greatness of the L\pointup{o}rd,\Flex\\
my spirit rejoices in G\pointup{o}d my Savior\Med\\
for he has looked with favor on his lowly s\pointup{e}rvant.

From this day all generations will call me bl\pointup{e}ssed:\Flex\\
the Almighty has done great th\pointup{\i}ngs for me,\Med\\
and holy is his N\pointup{a}me.

He has mercy on th\pointup{o}se who fear him\Med\\
in every gener\pointup{a}tion.

He has shown the strength \pointup{o}f his arm,\Med\\
he has scattered the proud in their conc\pointup{e}it.

He has cast down the mighty fr\pointup{o}m their thrones,\Med\\
and has lifted up the l\pointup{o}wly.

He has filled the hungry w\pointup{\i}th good things,\Med\\
and the rich he has sent away \pointup{e}mpty.

He has come to the help of his s\pointup{e}rvant Israel\Med\\
for he has remembered his promise of m\pointup{e}rcy,\\
the promise he made t\pointup{o} our fathers,\Med\\
to Abraham and his children for \pointup{e}ver.

Glory to the Father, and t\pointup{o} the Son,\Med\\
and to the Holy Sp\pointup{\i}rit:\\
as it was in the beginn\pointup{\i}ng, is now,\Med\\
and will be for ever. Am\pointup{e}n.
