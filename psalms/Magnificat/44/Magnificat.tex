\FirstLetter{M}y soul proclaims the greatness of the L\pointup{o}rd,\Flex\\
my spirit rejoices in G\pointup{o}d my Savior\Med\\
for he has looked with favor on his l\pointup{o}wly servant.

From this day all generations will call me bl\pointup{e}ssed:\Flex\\
the Almighty has done great th\pointup{\i}ngs for me,\Med\\
and holy \pointup{\i}s his Name.

He has mercy on th\pointup{o}se who fear him\Med\\
in every g\pointup{e}neration.

He has shown the strength \pointup{o}f his arm,\Med\\
he has scattered the proud in th\pointup{e}ir conceit.

He has cast down the mighty fr\pointup{o}m their thrones,\Med\\
and has lifted \pointup{u}p the lowly.

He has filled the hungry w\pointup{\i}th good things,\Med\\
and the rich he has sent \pointup{a}way empty.

He has come to the help of his s\pointup{e}rvant Israel\Med\\
for he has remembered his prom\pointup{\i}se of mercy,\\
the promise he made t\pointup{o} our fathers,\Med\\
to Abraham and his childr\pointup{e}n for ever.

Glory to the Father, and t\pointup{o} the Son,\Med\\
and to the H\pointup{o}ly Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginn\pointup{\i}ng, is now,\Med\\
and will be for ev\pointup{e}r. Amen.
