Nunc Dimittis

Lord, now you let your servant go in peace;
your word has been fulfilled.

My own eyes have seen the salvation
which you have prepared in the sight of every people:

a light to reveal you to the nations
and the glory of your people Israel.

Glory to the Father and to the Son,
and to the Holy Spirit:

as it was in the beginning, is now,
and will be forever, Amen.
