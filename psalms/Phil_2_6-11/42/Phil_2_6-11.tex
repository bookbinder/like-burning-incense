    \FirstLetter{T}hough he was in the form of G\pointup{o}d,\Flex\\
    Jesus did not deem equalit\pointup{y} with God\Med\\
    something to be gr\pointup{a}sped at.
    
    Rather, he emptied hims\pointup{e}lf\Flex\\
    and took the form \pointup{o}f a slave,\Med\\
    being born in the likeness of m\pointup{e}n.
    
    He was known to be of hum\pointup{a}n estate,\Med\\
    and it was thus that he humbled hims\pointup{e}lf,\\
    obediently accepting \pointup{e}ven death,\Med\\
    death on a cr\pointup{o}ss!
    
    Because of this, God highly ex\pointup{a}lted him\Med\\
    and bestowed on him the name above every other n\pointup{a}me,
    
    So that at Jesusâ€™ name every kn\pointup{e}e must bend\Med\\
    in the heavens, on the earth, and under the \pointup{e}arth,\\
    and every tongue proclaim to the glory of G\pointup{o}d the Father:\Med\\
    JESUS CHRIST IS L\pointup{O}RD!

    Glory to the Father and t\pointup{o} the Son,\Med\\
    and to the Holy Sp\pointup{\i}rit:\\
    as it was in the beginn\pointup{\i}ng, is now,\Med\\
    and will be forever. Am\pointup{e}n.
