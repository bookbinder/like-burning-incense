    Jesus did not deem equalit\pointup{y} with God\Med\\
    something to b\pointup{e} grasped at.
    
    Rather, he emptied hims\pointup{e}lf\Flex\\
    and took the form \pointup{o}f a slave,\Med\\
    being born in the likeness \pointup{o}f men.

    and it was thus that he humbled h\pointup{\i}mself,\\
    obediently accepting \pointup{e}ven death,\Med\\
    death on \pointup{a} cross!
    
    Because of this, God highly ex\pointup{a}lted him\Med\\
    and bestowed on him the name above every oth\pointup{e}r name,
    
    So that at Jesusâ€™ name every kn\pointup{e}e must bend\Med\\

    and every tongue proclaim to the glory of G\pointup{o}d the Father:\Med\\
    JESUS CHRIST \pointup{I}S LORD!

    Glory to the Father and t\pointup{o} the Son,\Med\\

    as it was in the beginn\pointup{\i}ng, is now,\Med\\
    and will be forever. \pointupl{A}men.
