\FirstLetter{M}y song is of mercy \pointup{a}nd justice;\Med\\
I sing to you, \pointup{O} Lord.\\
I will walk in the way of p\pointup{e}rfection.\Med\\
O when, Lord, will y\pointup{o}u come?

I will walk with blamel\pointup{e}ss heart\Med\\
within m\pointup{y} house;\\
I will not set before m\pointup{y} eyes\Med\\
whatever \pointup{\i}s base.

I will hate the ways of th\pointup{e} crooked;\Med\\
they shall not be m\pointup{y} friends.\\
The false-hearted must keep far \pointup{a}way;\Med\\
the wicked I d\pointup{\i}sown.

The man who slanders his neighbour \pointup{\i}n secret\Med\\
I will bring t\pointup{o} silence.\\
The man of proud looks and haught\pointup{y} heart\Med\\
I will never \pointup{e}ndure.

I look to the faithful in th\pointup{e} land\Med\\
that they may dwell w\pointup{\i}th me.\\
He who walks in the way of p\pointup{e}rfection\Med\\
shall be m\pointup{y} friend.

No man who practises d\pointup{e}ceit\Med\\
shall live within m\pointup{y} house.\\
No man who utters lies sh\pointup{a}ll stand\Med\\
before m\pointup{y} eyes.

Morning by morning I w\pointup{\i}ll silence\Med\\
all the wicked in th\pointup{e} land,\\
uprooting from the city of th\pointup{e} Lord\Med\\
all who d\pointup{o} evil.

Glory to the Father and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginning, \pointup{\i}s now,\Med\\
and will be for ever. \pointupl{A}men.
