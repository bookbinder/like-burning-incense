\FirstLetter{M}y song is of merc\pointup{y} and justice;\Med\\
I sing to you, \pointup{O} Lord.\\
I will walk in the way \pointup{o}f perfection.\Med\\
O when, Lord, will y\pointup{o}u come?

I will walk with bl\pointup{a}meless heart\Med\\
within m\pointup{y} house;\\
I will not set bef\pointup{o}re my eyes\Med\\
whatever \pointup{\i}s base.

I will hate the ways \pointup{o}f the crooked;\Med\\
they shall not be m\pointup{y} friends.\\
The false-hearted must keep f\pointup{a}r away;\Med\\
the wicked I d\pointup{\i}sown.

The man who slanders his neighb\pointup{o}ur in secret\Med\\
I will bring t\pointup{o} silence.\\
The man of proud looks and h\pointup{a}ughty heart\Med\\
I will never \pointup{e}ndure.

I look to the faithful \pointup{\i}n the land\Med\\
that they may dwell w\pointup{\i}th me.\\
He who walks in the way \pointup{o}f perfection\Med\\
shall be m\pointup{y} friend.

No man who practis\pointup{e}s deceit\Med\\
shall live within m\pointup{y} house.\\
No man who utters l\pointup{\i}es shall stand\Med\\
before m\pointup{y} eyes.

Morning by morning \pointup{I} will silence\Med\\
all the wicked in th\pointup{e} land,\\
uprooting from the city \pointup{o}f the Lord\Med\\
all who d\pointup{o} evil.

Glory to the Father and t\pointup{o} the Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginn\pointup{\i}ng, is now,\Med\\
and will be for ever. \pointupl{A}men.
