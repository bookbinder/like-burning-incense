\FirstLetter{M}y heart is read\pointup{y}, O God;\Med\\
I will sing, sing y\pointup{o}ur praise.\\
Awake, my s\pointup{o}ul;\Flex\\
awake, l\pointup{y}re and harp,\Med\\
I will awake th\pointup{e} dawn.

I will thank you, Lord, am\pointup{o}ng the peoples,\Med\\
among the nations I w\pointup{\i}ll praise you,\\
for your love reaches t\pointup{o} the heavens\Med\\
and your truth to th\pointup{e} skies.\\
O God, arise ab\pointup{o}ve the heavens;\Med\\
may your glory shine \pointup{o}n earth!

O come and deliv\pointup{e}r your friends;\Med\\
help with your right hand and r\pointup{e}ply.\\
From his holy place God has made this prom\pointup{\i}se;\Flex\\
‘I will triumph and divide the l\pointup{a}nd of Shechem,\\
I will measure out the valley \pointup{o}f Succoth.

Gilead is mine \pointup{a}nd Manasseh,\Med\\
Ephraim I take for m\pointup{y} helmet,\\
Judah for my comm\pointup{a}nder’s staff.\Med\\
Moab I will use for m\pointup{y} washbowl,\\
on Edom I will pl\pointup{a}nt my shoe.\Med\\
Over the Philistines I will shout \pointup{\i}n triumph.’

But who will lead me to conq\pointup{u}er the fortress?\Med\\
Who will bring me face to face w\pointup{\i}th Edom?\\
Will you utterly reject \pointup{u}s, O God,\Med\\
and no longer march with \pointup{o}ur armies?

Give us help ag\pointup{a}inst the foe,\Med\\
for the help of man \pointup{\i}s vain.\\
With God we sh\pointup{a}ll do bravely\Med\\
and he will trample down \pointup{o}ur foes.

Glory to the Father and t\pointup{o} the Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginn\pointup{\i}ng, is now,\Med\\
and will be for ever. \pointupl{A}men.
