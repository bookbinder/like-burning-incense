\FirstLetter{I}n the Lord I have taken my ref\pointup{u}ge.\Flex\\
How can you say to m\pointup{y} soul:\Med\\
“Fly like a bird to \pointup{\i}ts mountain.

See the wicked bracing th\pointup{e}ir bow;\Med\\
they are fixing their arrows on th\pointup{e} string\\
to shoot upright men in th\pointup{e} dark.\Med\\
Foundations once destroyed, what can the j\pointup{u}st do?”

The Lord is in his hol\pointup{y} temple,\Med\\
the Lord, whose throne is \pointup{\i}n heaven.\\
His eyes look down on th\pointup{e} world;\Med\\
his gaze tests mort\pointup{a}l men.

The Lord tests the just and th\pointup{e} wicked:\Med\\
the lover of violence h\pointup{e} hates.\\
He sends fire and brimstone on th\pointup{e} wicked;\Med\\
he sends a scorching wind as th\pointup{e}ir lot.

The Lord is just and l\pointup{o}ves justice:\Med\\
the upright shall see h\pointup{\i}s face.

Glory to the Father, and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginning, \pointup{\i}s now,\Med\\
and will be for ever. \pointupl{A}men.
