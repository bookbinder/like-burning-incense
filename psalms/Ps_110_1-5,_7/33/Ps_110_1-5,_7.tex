\FirstLetter{T}he Lord’s revelation to my M\pointup{a}ster:\Flex\\
“Sit on m\pointup{y} right:\Med\\
your foes I will put beneath y\pointup{o}ur feet.”

The Lord will wield from Z\pointup{\i}on\Flex\\
your scepter \pointup{o}f power:\Med\\
rule in the midst of all y\pointup{o}ur foes.

A prince from the day of your b\pointup{\i}rth\Flex\\
on the hol\pointup{y} mountains;\Med\\
from the womb before the dawn I b\pointup{e}got you.

The Lord has sworn an oath he will not ch\pointup{a}nge.\Flex\\
“You are a priest f\pointup{o}r ever,\Med\\
a priest like Melchizedek \pointup{o}f old.”

The Master standing at your r\pointup{\i}ght hand\Med\\
will shatter kings in the day of his gr\pointup{e}at wrath.\\
He shall drink from the stream by th\pointup{e} wayside\Med\\
and therefore he shall lift up h\pointup{\i}s head.

Glory to the Father and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginning, \pointup{\i}s now,\Med\\
and will be forever. \pointupl{A}men.
