\FirstLetter{T}he Lord’s revelation to my M\pointup{a}ster:\Flex\\
“Sit on m\pointup{y} right:\Med\\
your foes I will put ben\pointup{e}ath your feet.”

The Lord will wield from Z\pointup{\i}on\Flex\\
your scepter \pointup{o}f power:\Med\\
rule in the midst of \pointup{a}ll your foes.

A prince from the day of your b\pointup{\i}rth\Flex\\
on the hol\pointup{y} mountains;\Med\\
from the womb before the dawn \pointup{I} begot you.

The Lord has sworn an oath he will not ch\pointup{a}nge.\Flex\\
“You are a priest f\pointup{o}r ever,\Med\\
a priest like Melchized\pointup{e}k of old.”

The Master standing at your r\pointup{\i}ght hand\Med\\
will shatter kings in the day of h\pointup{\i}s great wrath.\\
He shall drink from the stream by th\pointup{e} wayside\Med\\
and therefore he shall lift \pointup{u}p his head.

Glory to the Father and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
and to the H\pointup{o}ly Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginning, \pointup{\i}s now,\Med\\
and will be forev\pointup{e}r. Amen.
