I will thank the Lord with all my heart
    in the meeting of the just and their assembly.
Great are the works of the Lord,
    to be pondered by all who love them.

Majestic and glorious his work,
    his justice stands firm for ever.
He makes us remember his wonders.
    The Lord is compassion and love.

He gives food to those who fear him;
    keeps his covenant ever in mind.
He has shown his might to his people
    by giving them the lands of the nations.

His works are justice and truth,
    his precepts are all of them sure,
standing firm for ever and ever;
    they are made in uprightness and truth.

He has sent deliverance to his people
    and established his covenant for ever.
    Holy his name, to be feared.

To fear the Lord is the first stage of wisdom;
    all who do so prove themselves wise.
His praise shall last for ever!

Glory to the Father and to the Son,
    and to the Holy Spirit:
as it was in the beginning, is now,
    and will be for ever. Amen.
