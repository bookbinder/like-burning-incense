\FirstLetter{H}appy the man who fears th\pointup{e} Lord,\Med\\
who takes delight in all his c\pointup{o}mmands.\\
His sons shall be powerful \pointup{o}n earth;\Med\\
the children of the upright \pointup{a}re blessed.

Riches and wealth are in h\pointup{i}s house;\Med\\
his justice stands firm f\pointup{o}r ever.\\
He is a light in the darkness for th\pointup{e} upright:\Med\\
he is generous, merciful \pointup{a}nd just.

The good man takes pity \pointup{a}nd lends,\Med\\
he conducts his affairs w\pointup{i}th honor.\\
The just man will nev\pointup{e}r waver:\Med\\
he will be remembered f\pointup{o}r ever.

He has no fear of ev\pointup{i}l news;\Med\\
with a firm heart he trusts in th\pointup{e} Lord.\\
With a steadfast heart he will n\pointup{o}t fear;\Med\\
he will see the downfall of h\pointup{i}s foes.

Open-handed, he gives to the p\pointup{o}or;\Flex\\
his justice stands firm f\pointup{o}r ever.\Med\\
His head will be raised \pointup{i}n glory.

The wicked man sees and is angr\pointup{y},\Flex\\
grinds his teeth and fades \pointup{a}way;\Med\\
the desire of the wicked leads t\pointup{o} doom.

Glory to the Father and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginning, \pointup{i}s now,\Med\\
and will be forever. \pointup{A}men.
