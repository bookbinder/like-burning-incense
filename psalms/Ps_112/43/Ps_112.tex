the children of the upright \pointup{a}re blessed.

Riches and wealth are \pointup{\i}n his house;\Med\\
his justice stands firm f\pointup{o}r ever.\\
He is a light in the darkness f\pointup{o}r the upright:\Med\\

Glory to the Father and t\pointup{o} the Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginn\pointup{\i}ng, is now,\Med\\
and will be forever. \pointupl{A}men.
