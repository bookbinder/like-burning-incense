\FirstLetter{H}appy the man who f\pointup{e}ars the Lord,\Med\\
who takes delight in all h\pointup{\i}s commands.\\
His sons shall be powerf\pointup{u}l on earth;\Med\\
the children of the upr\pointup{\i}ght are blessed.

Riches and wealth are \pointup{\i}n his house;\Med\\
his justice stands f\pointup{\i}rm for ever.\\
He is a light in the darkness f\pointup{o}r the upright:\Med\\
he is generous, mercif\pointup{u}l and just.

The good man takes pit\pointup{y} and lends,\Med\\
he conducts his aff\pointup{a}irs with honor.\\
The just man will n\pointup{e}ver waver:\Med\\
he will be rememb\pointup{e}red for ever.

He has no fear of \pointup{e}vil news;\Med\\
with a firm heart he trusts \pointup{\i}n the Lord.\\
With a steadfast heart he w\pointup{\i}ll not fear;\Med\\
he will see the downfall \pointup{o}f his foes.

Open-handed, he gives to the p\pointup{o}or;\Flex\\
his justice stands f\pointup{\i}rm for ever.\Med\\
His head will be r\pointup{a}ised in glory.

The wicked man sees and is angr\pointup{y},\Flex\\
grinds his teeth and f\pointup{a}des away;\Med\\
the desire of the wicked l\pointup{e}ads to doom.

Glory to the Father and t\pointup{o} the Son,\Med\\
and to the H\pointup{o}ly Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginn\pointup{\i}ng, is now,\Med\\
and will be forev\pointup{e}r. Amen.
