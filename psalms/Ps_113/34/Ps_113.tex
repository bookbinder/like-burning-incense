\FirstLetter{P}raise, O servants of th\pointup{e} Lord,\Med\\
praise the name \pointup{o}f the Lord!\\
May the name of the Lord b\pointup{e} blessed\Med\\
both now and for \pointup{e}vermore!\\
From the rising of the sun to \pointup{\i}ts setting\Med\\
praised be the name \pointup{o}f the Lord!

High above all nations is th\pointup{e} Lord,\Med\\
above the heav\pointup{e}ns his glory.\\
Who is like the Lord, \pointup{o}ur God,\Med\\
who has risen on high t\pointup{o} his throne\\
yet stoops from the heights to l\pointup{o}ok down,\Med\\
to look down upon heav\pointup{e}n and earth?

From the dust he lifts up th\pointup{e} lowly,\Med\\
from his misery he rais\pointup{e}s the poor\\
to set him in the company \pointup{o}f princes,\Med\\
yes, with the princes \pointup{o}f his people.\\
To the childless wife he gives \pointup{a} home\Med\\
and gladdens her h\pointup{e}art with children.

Glory to the Father and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
and to the H\pointup{o}ly Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginning, \pointup{\i}s now,\Med\\
and will be forev\pointup{e}r. Amen.
