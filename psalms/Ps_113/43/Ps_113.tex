\FirstLetter{P}raise, O servants \pointup{o}f the Lord,\Med\\
praise the name of th\pointup{e} Lord!\\
May the name of the L\pointup{o}rd be blessed\Med\\
both now and for ev\pointup{e}rmore!\\
From the rising of the sun t\pointup{o} its setting\Med\\
praised be the name of th\pointup{e} Lord!

High above all nations \pointup{\i}s the Lord,\Med\\
above the heavens h\pointup{\i}s glory.\\
Who is like the L\pointup{o}rd, our God,\Med\\
who has risen on high to h\pointup{\i}s throne\\
yet stoops from the heights t\pointup{o} look down,\Med\\
to look down upon heaven \pointup{a}nd earth?

From the dust he lifts \pointup{u}p the lowly,\Med\\
from his misery he raises th\pointup{e} poor\\
to set him in the compan\pointup{y} of princes,\Med\\
yes, with the princes of h\pointup{\i}s people.\\
To the childless wife he g\pointup{\i}ves a home\Med\\
and gladdens her heart w\pointup{\i}th children.

Glory to the Father and t\pointup{o} the Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginn\pointup{\i}ng, is now,\Med\\
and will be forever. \pointupl{A}men.
