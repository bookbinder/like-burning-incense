\FirstLetter{P}raise, O servants of th\pointup{e} Lord,\Med\\
praise the name of th\pointup{e} Lord!\\
May the name of the Lord b\pointup{e} blessed\Med\\
both now and for ev\pointup{e}rmore!\\
From the rising of the sun to \pointup{\i}ts setting\Med\\
praised be the name of th\pointup{e} Lord!

High above all nations is th\pointup{e} Lord,\Med\\
above the heavens h\pointup{\i}s glory.\\
Who is like the Lord, \pointup{o}ur God,\Med\\
who has risen on high to h\pointup{\i}s throne\\
yet stoops from the heights to l\pointup{o}ok down,\Med\\
to look down upon heaven \pointup{a}nd earth?

From the dust he lifts up th\pointup{e} lowly,\Med\\
from his misery he raises th\pointup{e} poor\\
to set him in the company \pointup{o}f princes,\Med\\
yes, with the princes of h\pointup{\i}s people.\\
To the childless wife he gives \pointup{a} home\Med\\
and gladdens her heart w\pointup{\i}th children.

Glory to the Father and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginning, \pointup{\i}s now,\Med\\
and will be forever. \pointupl{A}men.
