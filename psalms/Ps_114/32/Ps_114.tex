\FirstLetter{W}hen Israel came forth fr\pointup{o}m Egypt,\Med\\
Jacob’s sons from an alien p\pointup{e}ople,\\
Judah became the L\pointup{o}rd’s temple,\Med\\
Israel became his k\pointup{\i}ngdom.

The sea fled at th\pointup{e} sight:\Med\\
the Jordan turned back on its c\pointup{o}urse,\\
the mountains leapt l\pointup{\i}ke rams\Med\\
and the hills like yearling sh\pointup{e}ep.

Why was it, sea, that y\pointup{o}u fled,\Med\\
that you turned back, Jordan, on your c\pointup{o}urse?\\
Mountains, that you leapt l\pointup{\i}ke rams,\Med\\
hills, like yearling sh\pointup{e}ep?

Tremble, O earth, before th\pointup{e} Lord,\Med\\
in the presence of the God of J\pointup{a}cob,\\
who turns the rock into \pointup{a} pool\Med\\
and flint into a spring of w\pointup{a}ter.

Glory to the Father and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
and to the Holy Sp\pointup{\i}rit:\\
as it was in the beginning, \pointup{\i}s now,\Med\\
and will be forever. Am\pointup{e}n.
