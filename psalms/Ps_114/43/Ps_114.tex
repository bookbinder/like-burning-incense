\FirstLetter{W}hen Israel came f\pointup{o}rth from Egypt,\Med\\
Jacob’s sons from an ali\pointup{e}n people,\\
Judah became th\pointup{e} Lord’s temple,\Med\\
Israel became h\pointup{\i}s kingdom.

The sea fled \pointup{a}t the sight:\Med\\
the Jordan turned back on \pointup{\i}ts course,\\
the mountains l\pointup{e}apt like rams\Med\\
and the hills like yearl\pointup{\i}ng sheep.

Why was it, sea, th\pointup{a}t you fled,\Med\\
that you turned back, Jordan, on y\pointup{o}ur course?\\
Mountains, that you l\pointup{e}apt like rams,\Med\\
hills, like yearl\pointup{\i}ng sheep?

Tremble, O earth, bef\pointup{o}re the Lord,\Med\\
in the presence of the God \pointup{o}f Jacob,\\
who turns the rock int\pointup{o} a pool\Med\\
and flint into a spring \pointup{o}f water.

Glory to the Father and t\pointup{o} the Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginn\pointup{\i}ng, is now,\Med\\
and will be forever. \pointupl{A}men.
