\FirstLetter{W}hen Israel came f\pointup{o}rth from Egypt,\Med\\
Jacob’s sons from an \pointup{a}lien people,\\
Judah became th\pointup{e} Lord’s temple,\Med\\
Israel bec\pointup{a}me his kingdom.

The sea fled \pointup{a}t the sight:\Med\\
the Jordan turned back \pointup{o}n its course,\\
the mountains l\pointup{e}apt like rams\Med\\
and the hills like y\pointup{e}arling sheep.

Why was it, sea, th\pointup{a}t you fled,\Med\\
that you turned back, Jordan, \pointup{o}n your course?\\
Mountains, that you l\pointup{e}apt like rams,\Med\\
hills, like y\pointup{e}arling sheep?

Tremble, O earth, bef\pointup{o}re the Lord,\Med\\
in the presence of the G\pointup{o}d of Jacob,\\
who turns the rock int\pointup{o} a pool\Med\\
and flint into a spr\pointup{\i}ng of water.

Glory to the Father and t\pointup{o} the Son,\Med\\
and to the H\pointup{o}ly Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginn\pointup{\i}ng, is now,\Med\\
and will be forev\pointup{e}r. Amen.
