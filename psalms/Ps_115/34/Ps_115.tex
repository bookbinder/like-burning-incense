\FirstLetter{N}ot to us, Lord, not t\pointup{o} us,\Med\\
but to your name g\pointup{i}ve the glory\\
for the sake of your love and y\pointup{o}ur truth,\Med\\
lest the heathen say: “Where \pointup{i}s their God?”

But our God is in th\pointup{e} heavens;\Med\\
he does whatev\pointup{e}r he wills.\\
Their idols are silver \pointup{a}nd gold,\Med\\
the work of h\pointup{u}man hands.

They have mouths but they can\pointup{n}ot speak;\Med\\
they have eyes but they c\pointup{a}nnot see;\\
they have ears but they cann\pointup{o}t hear;\Med\\
they have nostrils but they c\pointup{a}nnot smell.

With their hands they cann\pointup{o}t feel;\Flex\\
with their feet they cann\pointup{o}t walk.\Med\\
No sound comes fr\pointup{o}m their throats.\\
Their makers will come to be l\pointup{\i}ke them\Med\\
and so will all who tr\pointup{u}st in them.

Sons of Israel, trust in th\pointup{e} Lord;\Med\\
he is their help \pointup{a}nd their shield\\
Sons of Aaron, trust in th\pointup{e} Lord;\Med\\
he is their help \pointup{a}nd their shield.

You who fear him, trust in th\pointup{e} Lord;\Med\\
he is their help \pointup{a}nd their shield.\\
He remembers us, and he will bless \pointup{u}s;\Flex\\
he will bless the sons \pointup{o}f Israel.\Med\\
He will bless the s\pointup{o}ns of Aaron.

The Lord will bless those wh\pointup{o} fear him,\Med\\
the little no less th\pointup{a}n the great:\\
to you may the Lord gr\pointup{a}nt increase,\Med\\
to you and \pointup{a}ll your children.

May you be blessed by th\pointup{e} Lord,\Med\\
the maker of heav\pointup{e}n and earth.\\
The heavens belong to th\pointup{e} Lord\Med\\
but the earth he has giv\pointup{e}n to men.

The dead shall not praise th\pointup{e} Lord,\Med\\
nor those who go down int\pointup{o} the silence.\\
But we who live bless th\pointup{e} Lord\Med\\
now and for ev\pointup{e}r. Amen.

Glory to the Father and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
and to the H\pointup{o}ly Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginning, \pointup{\i}s now,\Med\\
and will be forev\pointup{e}r. Amen.
