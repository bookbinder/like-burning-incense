\FirstLetter{N}ot to us, Lord, n\pointup{o}t to us,\Med\\
but to your name give th\pointup{e} glory\\
for the sake of your love \pointup{a}nd your truth,\Med\\
lest the heathen say: “Where is th\pointup{e}ir God?”

But our God is \pointup{\i}n the heavens;\Med\\
he does whatever h\pointup{e} wills.\\
Their idols are silv\pointup{e}r and gold,\Med\\
the work of hum\pointup{a}n hands.

They have mouths but they c\pointup{a}nnot speak;\Med\\
they have eyes but they cann\pointup{o}t see;\\
they have ears but they c\pointup{a}nnot hear;\Med\\
they have nostrils but they cann\pointup{o}t smell.

With their hands they cann\pointup{o}t feel;\Flex\\
with their feet they c\pointup{a}nnot walk.\Med\\
No sound comes from their thr\pointup{o}ats.\\
Their makers will come to b\pointup{e} like them\Med\\
and so will all who trust \pointup{\i}n them.

Sons of Israel, trust \pointup{\i}n the Lord;\Med\\
he is their help and th\pointup{e}ir shield\\
Sons of Aaron, trust \pointup{\i}n the Lord;\Med\\
he is their help and th\pointup{e}ir shield.

You who fear him, trust \pointup{\i}n the Lord;\Med\\
he is their help and th\pointup{e}ir shield.\\
He remembers us, and he will bless \pointup{u}s;\Flex\\
he will bless the s\pointup{o}ns of Israel.\Med\\
He will bless the sons \pointup{o}f Aaron.

The Lord will bless th\pointup{o}se who fear him,\Med\\
the little no less than th\pointup{e} great:\\
to you may the L\pointup{o}rd grant increase,\Med\\
to you and all y\pointup{o}ur children.

May you be blessed b\pointup{y} the Lord,\Med\\
the maker of heaven \pointup{a}nd earth.\\
The heavens belong t\pointup{o} the Lord\Med\\
but the earth he has given t\pointup{o} men.

The dead shall not pr\pointup{a}ise the Lord,\Med\\
nor those who go down into th\pointup{e} silence.\\
But we who live bl\pointup{e}ss the Lord\Med\\
now and for ever. \pointupl{A}men.

Glory to the Father and t\pointup{o} the Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginn\pointup{\i}ng, is now,\Med\\
and will be forever. \pointupl{A}men.
