\FirstLetter{I} love the Lord for he h\pointup{a}s heard\Med\\
the cry of my \pointup{a}ppeal;\\
for he turned his ear t\pointup{o} me\Med\\
in the day when \pointup{I} called him.

They surrounded me, the snares \pointup{o}f death,\Med\\
with the anguish of th\pointup{e} tomb;\\
they caught me, sorrow and distr\pointup{e}ss.\Flex\\
I called on the L\pointup{o}rdâ€™s name.\Med\\
O Lord, my God, deliv\pointup{e}r me!

How gracious is the Lord, \pointup{a}nd just;\Med\\
our God has c\pointup{o}mpassion.\\
The Lord protects the simpl\pointup{e} hearts;\Med\\
I was helpless so h\pointup{e} saved me.

Turn back, my soul, to y\pointup{o}ur rest\Med\\
for the Lord has b\pointup{e}en good;\\
he has kept my soul from d\pointup{e}ath,\Flex\\
my eyes fr\pointup{o}m tears\Med\\
and my feet fr\pointup{o}m stumbling.

I will walk in the presence of th\pointup{e} Lord\Med\\
in the land of th\pointup{e} living.

Glory to the Father, and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginning, \pointup{\i}s now,\Med\\
and will be for ever. \pointupl{A}men.
