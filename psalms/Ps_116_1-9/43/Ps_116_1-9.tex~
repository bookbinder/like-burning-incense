Psalm 116:1-9
Thanksgiving

We must endure many trials before entering God’s kingdom (Acts 14:21).

I love the Lord for he has heard *
the cry of my appeal;
for he turned his ear to me *
in the day when I called him.

They surrounded me, the snares of death, *
with the anguish of the tomb;
they caught me, sorrow and distress. *
I called on the Lord’s name.

O Lord, my God, deliver me!

How gracious is the Lord, and just; *
our God has compassion.
The Lord protects the simple hearts; *
I was helpless so he saved me.

Turn back, my soul, to your rest *
for the Lord has been good;
he has kept my soul from death, †
my eyes from tears *
and my feet from stumbling.

I will walk in the presence of the Lord *
in the land of the living.

Glory to the Father, and to the Son, *
and to the Holy Spirit:
as it was in the beginning, is now, *
and will be for ever. Amen.
