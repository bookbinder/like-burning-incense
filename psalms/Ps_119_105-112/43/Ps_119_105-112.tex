\FirstLetter{Y}our word is a lamp f\pointup{o}r my steps\Med\\
and a light for m\pointup{y} path.\\
I have sworn and have made \pointup{u}p my mind\Med\\
to obey your d\pointup{e}crees.

Lord, I am deepl\pointup{y} afflicted;\Med\\
by your word give me life.\\
Accept, Lord, the homage \pointup{o}f my lips\Med\\
and teach me your d\pointup{e}crees.

Though I carry my life \pointup{i}n my hands,\Med\\
I remember y\pointup{o}ur law.\\
Though the wicked try t\pointup{o} ensnare me,\Med\\
I do not stray from y\pointup{o}ur precepts.

Your will is my herit\pointup{a}ge for ever,\Med\\
the joy of m\pointup{y} heart.\\
I set myself to carry \pointup{o}ut your statutes\Med\\
in fullness, f\pointup{o}r ever.

Glory to the Father and t\pointup{o} the Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginn\pointup{i}ng, is now,\Med\\
and will be forever. \pointupl{A}men.
