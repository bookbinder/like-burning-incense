\FirstLetter{Y}our word is a lamp for m\pointup{y} steps\Med\\
and a light for m\pointup{y} path.\\
I have sworn and have made up m\pointup{y} mind\Med\\
to obey your d\pointup{e}crees.

Lord, I am deeply \pointup{a}fflicted;\Med\\
by your word give me life.\\
Accept, Lord, the homage of m\pointup{y} lips\Med\\
and teach me your d\pointup{e}crees.

Though I carry my life in m\pointup{y} hands,\Med\\
I remember y\pointup{o}ur law.\\
Though the wicked try to \pointup{e}nsnare me,\Med\\
I do not stray from y\pointup{o}ur precepts.

Your will is my heritage f\pointup{o}r ever,\Med\\
the joy of m\pointup{y} heart.\\
I set myself to carry out y\pointup{o}ur statutes\Med\\
in fullness, f\pointup{o}r ever.

Glory to the Father and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginning, \pointup{\i}s now,\Med\\
and will be forever. \pointupl{A}men.
