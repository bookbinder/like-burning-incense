    \FirstLetter{I} call with all my heart; L\pointup{o}rd, hear me,\Med\\
I will keep your c\pointup{o}mmands;\\
I call upon y\pointup{o}u, save me\Med\\
and I will do y\pointup{o}ur will.

I rise before dawn and cry f\pointup{o}r help,\Med\\
I hope in y\pointup{o}ur word.\\
My eyes watch through th\pointup{e} night\Med\\
to ponder y\pointup{o}ur promise.

In your love hear my voice, \pointup{O} Lord;\Med\\
give me life by your d\pointup{e}crees.\\
Those who harm me unjustly dr\pointup{a}w near:\Med\\
they are far from y\pointup{o}ur law.

But you, O Lord, \pointup{a}re close:\Med\\
your commands \pointup{a}re truth.\\
Long have I known that y\pointup{o}ur will\Med\\
is established f\pointup{o}r ever.

Glory to the Father, and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginning, \pointup{\i}s now,\Med\\
and will be for ever. \pointupl{A}men
