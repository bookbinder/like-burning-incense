    \FirstLetter{I} call with all my h\pointup{e}art; Lord, hear me,\Med\\
I will keep your comm\pointup{a}nds;\\
I call up\pointup{o}n you, save me\Med\\
and I will do your w\pointup{\i}ll.

I rise before dawn and cr\pointup{y} for help,\Med\\
I hope in your w\pointup{o}rd.\\
My eyes watch thr\pointup{o}ugh the night\Med\\
to ponder your pr\pointup{o}mise.

In your love hear my v\pointup{o}ice, O Lord;\Med\\
give me life by your decr\pointup{e}es.\\
Those who harm me unjustl\pointup{y} draw near:\Med\\
they are far from your l\pointup{a}w.

But you, O L\pointup{o}rd, are close:\Med\\
your commands are tr\pointup{u}th.\\
Long have I known th\pointup{a}t your will\Med\\
is established for \pointup{e}ver.

Glory to the Father, and t\pointup{o} the Son,\Med\\
and to the Holy Sp\pointup{\i}rit:\\
as it was in the beginn\pointup{\i}ng, is now,\Med\\
and will be for ever. Am\pointup{e}n
