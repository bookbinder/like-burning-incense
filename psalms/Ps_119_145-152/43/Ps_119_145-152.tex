    \FirstLetter{I} call with all my h\pointup{e}art; Lord, hear me,\Med\\
I will keep your c\pointup{o}mmands;\\
I call up\pointup{o}n you, save me\Med\\
and I will do y\pointup{o}ur will.

I rise before dawn and cr\pointup{y} for help,\Med\\
I hope in y\pointup{o}ur word.\\
My eyes watch thr\pointup{o}ugh the night\Med\\
to ponder y\pointup{o}ur promise.

In your love hear my v\pointup{o}ice, O Lord;\Med\\
give me life by your d\pointup{e}crees.\\
Those who harm me unjustl\pointup{y} draw near:\Med\\
they are far from y\pointup{o}ur law.

But you, O L\pointup{o}rd, are close:\Med\\
your commands \pointup{a}re truth.\\
Long have I known th\pointup{a}t your will\Med\\
is established f\pointup{o}r ever.

Glory to the Father, and t\pointup{o} the Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginn\pointup{\i}ng, is now,\Med\\
and will be for ever. \pointupl{A}men
