\FirstLetter{I} lift up my eyes to th\pointup{e} mountains: *\Med\\
from where shall come m\pointup{y} help?\\
My help shall come from th\pointup{e} Lord *\Med\\
who made heaven \pointup{a}nd earth.

May he never allow you t\pointup{o} stumble! *\Med\\
Let him sleep not, y\pointup{o}ur guard.\\
No, he sleeps not n\pointup{o}r slumbers, *\Med\\
Isra\pointup{e}lâ€™s guard.

The Lord is your guard and y\pointup{o}ur shade; *\Med\\
at your right side h\pointup{e} stands.\\
By day the sun shall n\pointup{o}t smite you *\Med\\
nor the moon in th\pointup{e} night.

The Lord will guard you fr\pointup{o}m evil, *\Med\\
he will guard y\pointup{o}ur soul.\\
The Lord will guard your going \pointup{a}nd coming *\Med\\
both now and f\pointup{o}r ever.

Glory to the Father, and to th\pointup{e} Son, *\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginning, \pointup{\i}s now, *\Med\\
and will be for ever. \pointupl{A}men.
