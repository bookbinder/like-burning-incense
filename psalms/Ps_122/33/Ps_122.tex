    \FirstLetter{I} rejoiced when I heard th\pointup{e}m say:\Med\\
    ‘Let us go to G\pointup{o}d’s house.’\\
And now our feet \pointup{a}re standing\Med\\
    within your gates, O J\pointup{e}rusalem.

Jerusalem is built as \pointup{a} city\Med\\
    strongly c\pointup{o}mpact.\\
It is there that the tribes g\pointup{o} up,\Med\\
    the tribes of th\pointup{e} Lord.

For Israel’s law \pointup{\i}t is,\Med\\
    there to praise the L\pointup{o}rd’s name.\\
There were set the thrones \pointup{o}f judgement\Med\\
    of the house \pointup{o}f David.

For the peace of Jerusal\pointup{e}m pray:\Med\\
    ‘Peace be to y\pointup{o}ur homes!\\
May peace reign in y\pointup{o}ur walls,\Med\\
    in your palac\pointup{e}s, peace!’

For love of my brethren \pointup{a}nd friends\Med\\
    I say: ‘Peace up\pointup{o}n you!’\\
For love of the house of th\pointup{e} Lord\Med\\
    I will ask for y\pointup{o}ur good.

Glory to the Father and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
    and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginning, \pointup{\i}s now,\Med\\
and will be for ever. \pointupl{A}men.
