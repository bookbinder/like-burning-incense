I rejoiced when I heard them say:
    ‘Let us go to God’s house.’
And now our feet are standing
    within your gates, O Jerusalem.

Jerusalem is built as a city
    strongly compact.
It is there that the tribes go up,
    the tribes of the Lord.

For Israel’s law it is,
    there to praise the Lord’s name.
There were set the thrones of judgement
    of the house of David.

For the peace of Jerusalem pray:
    ‘Peace be to your homes!
May peace reign in your walls,
    in your palaces, peace!’

For love of my brethren and friends
    I say: ‘Peace upon you!’
For love of the house of the Lord
    I will ask for your good.

Glory to the Father and to the Son,
    and to the Holy Spirit:
as it was in the beginning, is now,
    and will be for ever. Amen.
