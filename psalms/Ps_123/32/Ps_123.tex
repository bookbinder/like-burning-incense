\FirstLetter{T}o you have I lifted up m\pointup{y} eyes,\Med\\
you who dwell in the h\pointup{e}avens:\\
my eyes, like the eyes \pointup{o}f slaves\Med\\
on the hand of their l\pointup{o}rds.

Like the eyes of \pointup{a} servant\Med\\
on the hand of her m\pointup{\i}stress,\\
so our eyes are on the Lord \pointup{o}ur God\Med\\
till he show us his m\pointup{e}rcy.

Have mercy on us, Lord, h\pointup{a}ve mercy.\Med\\
We are filled with cont\pointup{e}mpt.\\
Indeed all too full is our s\pointup{o}ul\Flex\\
with the scorn of t\pointup{h}e rich,\Med\\
with the proud manâ€™s disd\pointup{a}in.

Glory to the Father and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
and to the Holy Sp\pointup{\i}rit:\\
as it was in the beginning, \pointup{\i}s now,\Med\\
and will be forever. Am\pointup{e}n.
