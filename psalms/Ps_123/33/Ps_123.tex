\FirstLetter{T}o you have I lifted up m\pointup{y} eyes,\Med\\
you who dwell in th\pointup{e} heavens:\\
my eyes, like the eyes \pointup{o}f slaves\Med\\
on the hand of th\pointup{e}ir lords.

Like the eyes of \pointup{a} servant\Med\\
on the hand of h\pointup{e}r mistress,\\
so our eyes are on the Lord \pointup{o}ur God\Med\\
till he show us h\pointup{\i}s mercy.

Have mercy on us, Lord, h\pointup{a}ve mercy.\Med\\
We are filled with c\pointup{o}ntempt.\\
Indeed all too full is our s\pointup{o}ul\Flex\\
with the scorn of t\pointup{h}e rich,\Med\\
with the proud manâ€™s d\pointup{\i}sdain.

Glory to the Father and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginning, \pointup{\i}s now,\Med\\
and will be forever. \pointupl{A}men.
