\FirstLetter{T}o you have I lifted \pointup{u}p my eyes,\Med\\
you who dwell \pointup{\i}n the heavens:\\
my eyes, like the \pointup{e}yes of slaves\Med\\
on the hand \pointup{o}f their lords.

Like the eyes \pointup{o}f a servant\Med\\
on the hand \pointup{o}f her mistress,\\
so our eyes are on the L\pointup{o}rd our God\Med\\
till he show \pointup{u}s his mercy.

Have mercy on us, L\pointup{o}rd, have mercy.\Med\\
We are filled w\pointup{\i}th contempt.\\
Indeed all too full is our s\pointup{o}ul\Flex\\
with the scorn \pointup{o}f the rich,\Med\\
with the proud m\pointup{a}nâ€™s disdain.

Glory to the Father and t\pointup{o} the Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginn\pointup{\i}ng, is now,\Med\\
and will be forev\pointup{e}r. Amen.
