\FirstLetterQ{I}f the Lord had not been on \pointup{o}ur side,”\Med\\
this is Isra\pointup{e}l’s song.\\
“If the Lord had not been on \pointup{o}ur side\Med\\
when men rose \pointup{a}gainst us,\\
then would they have swallowed us \pointup{a}live\Med\\
when their anger w\pointup{a}s kindled.

Then would the waters have \pointup{e}ngulfed us,\Med\\
the torrent gone ov\pointup{e}r us;\\
over our head would h\pointup{a}ve swept\Med\\
the rag\pointup{\i}ng waters.”

Blessed be the Lord who did n\pointup{o}t give us\Med\\
a prey to th\pointup{e}ir teeth!\\
Our life, like a bird, has \pointup{e}scaped\Med\\
from the snare of th\pointup{e} fowler.

Indeed the snare has b\pointup{e}en broken\Med\\
and we have \pointup{e}scaped.\\
Our help is in the name of th\pointup{e} Lord,\Med\\
who made heaven \pointup{a}nd earth.

Glory to the Father and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginning, \pointup{\i}s now,\Med\\
and will be forever. \pointupl{A}men.
