\FirstLetter{T}hose who put their trust in the L\pointup{o}rd\Flex\\
are like Mount Zion, that cannot b\pointup{e} shaken,\Med\\
that st\pointup{a}nds for ever.

Jerusalem! The mountains surround h\pointup{e}r,\Flex\\
so the Lord surrounds h\pointup{i}s people\Med\\
both now \pointup{a}nd for ever.

For the scepter of the wicked shall n\pointup{o}t rest\Med\\
over the land \pointup{o}f the just\\
for fear that the hands of th\pointup{e} just\Med\\
should t\pointup{u}rn to evil.

Do good, Lord, to those who \pointup{a}re good,\Med\\
to the upr\pointup{i}ght of heart;\\
but the crooked and those who do ev\pointup{\i}l,\Flex\\
drive them \pointup{a}way!\Med\\
On Isr\pointup{a}el, peace!

Glory to the Father and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
and to the H\pointup{o}ly Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginning, \pointup{i}s now,\Med\\
and will be forev\pointup{e}r. Amen.
