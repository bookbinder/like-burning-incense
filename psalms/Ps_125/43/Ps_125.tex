\FirstLetter{T}hose who put their trust in the L\pointup{o}rd\Flex\\
are like Mount Zion, that cann\pointup{o}t be shaken,\Med\\
that stands f\pointup{o}r ever.

Jerusalem! The mountains surround h\pointup{e}r,\Flex\\
so the Lord surr\pointup{o}unds his people\Med\\
both now and f\pointup{o}r ever.

For the scepter of the wicked sh\pointup{a}ll not rest\Med\\
over the land of th\pointup{e} just\\
for fear that the hands \pointup{o}f the just\Med\\
should turn t\pointup{o} evil.

Do good, Lord, to those wh\pointup{o} are good,\Med\\
to the upright \pointup{o}f heart;\\
but the crooked and those who do ev\pointup{\i}l,\Flex\\
drive th\pointup{e}m away!\Med\\
On Isra\pointup{e}l, peace!

Glory to the Father and t\pointup{o} the Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginn\pointup{\i}ng, is now,\Med\\
and will be forever. \pointupl{A}men.
