\FirstLetter{W}hen the Lord delivered Zion fr\pointup{o}m bondage,\Med\\
it seemed like a dr\pointup{e}am.\\
Then was our mouth filled w\pointup{\i}th laughter,\Med\\
on our lips there were s\pointup{o}ngs.

The heathens themselves said: “Wh\pointup{a}t marvels\Med\\
the Lord worked for th\pointup{e}m!”\\
What marvels the Lord worked f\pointup{o}r us!\Med\\
Indeed we were gl\pointup{a}d.

Deliver us, O Lord, from \pointup{o}ur bondage\Med\\
as streams in dry l\pointup{a}nd.\\
Those who are sowing \pointup{\i}n tears\Med\\
will sing when they r\pointup{e}ap.

They go out, they go out, full \pointup{o}f tears,\Med\\
carrying seed for the s\pointup{o}wing:\\
they come back, they come back, full \pointup{o}f song,\Med\\
carrying their sh\pointup{e}aves.

Glory to the Father and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
and to the Holy Sp\pointup{i}rit:\\
as it was in the beginning, \pointup{\i}s now,\Med\\
and will be forever. Am\pointup{e}n.
