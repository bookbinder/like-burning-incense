\FirstLetter{W}hen the Lord delivered Zion fr\pointup{o}m bondage,\Med\\
it seemed like \pointup{a} dream.\\
Then was our mouth filled w\pointup{\i}th laughter,\Med\\
on our lips there w\pointup{e}re songs.

The heathens themselves said: “Wh\pointup{a}t marvels\Med\\
the Lord worked f\pointup{o}r them!”\\
What marvels the Lord worked f\pointup{o}r us!\Med\\
Indeed we w\pointup{e}re glad.

Deliver us, O Lord, from \pointup{o}ur bondage\Med\\
as streams in dr\pointup{y} land.\\
Those who are sowing \pointup{\i}n tears\Med\\
will sing when th\pointup{e}y reap.

They go out, they go out, full \pointup{o}f tears,\Med\\
carrying seed for th\pointup{e} sowing:\\
they come back, they come back, full \pointup{o}f song,\Med\\
carrying th\pointup{e}ir sheaves.

Glory to the Father and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginning, \pointup{\i}s now,\Med\\
and will be forever. \pointupl{A}men.
