\FirstLetter{W}hen the Lord delivered Zion fr\pointup{o}m bondage,\Med\\
it seemed l\pointup{\i}ke a dream.\\
Then was our mouth filled w\pointup{\i}th laughter,\Med\\
on our lips th\pointup{e}re were songs.

The heathens themselves said: “Wh\pointup{a}t marvels\Med\\
the Lord w\pointup{o}rked for them!”\\
What marvels the Lord worked f\pointup{o}r us!\Med\\
Indeed w\pointup{e} were glad.

Deliver us, O Lord, from \pointup{o}ur bondage\Med\\
as streams \pointup{\i}n dry land.\\
Those who are sowing \pointup{\i}n tears\Med\\
will sing wh\pointup{e}n they reap.

They go out, they go out, full \pointup{o}f tears,\Med\\
carrying seed f\pointup{o}r the sowing:\\
they come back, they come back, full \pointup{o}f song,\Med\\
carry\pointup{\i}ng their sheaves.

Glory to the Father and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
and to the H\pointup{o}ly Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginning, \pointup{\i}s now,\Med\\
and will be forev\pointup{e}r. Amen.
