\FirstLetter{W}hen the Lord delivered Z\pointup{\i}on from bondage,\Med\\
it seemed like \pointup{a} dream.\\
Then was our mouth f\pointup{\i}lled with laughter,\Med\\
on our lips there w\pointup{e}re songs.

The heathens themselves s\pointup{a}id: “What marvels\Med\\
the Lord worked f\pointup{o}r them!”\\
What marvels the Lord w\pointup{o}rked for us!\Med\\
Indeed we w\pointup{e}re glad.

Deliver us, O Lord, fr\pointup{o}m our bondage\Med\\
as streams in dr\pointup{y} land.\\
Those who are sow\pointup{\i}ng in tears\Med\\
will sing when th\pointup{e}y reap.

They go out, they go out, f\pointup{u}ll of tears,\Med\\
carrying seed for th\pointup{e} sowing:\\
they come back, they come back, f\pointup{u}ll of song,\Med\\
carrying th\pointup{e}ir sheaves.

Glory to the Father and t\pointup{o} the Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginn\pointup{\i}ng, is now,\Med\\
and will be forever. \pointupl{A}men.
