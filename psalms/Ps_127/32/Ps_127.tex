\FirstLetter{I}f the Lord does not build th\pointup{e} house,\Med\\
in vain do its builders l\pointup{a}bor;\\
if the Lord does not watch over th\pointup{e} city,\Med\\
in vain does the watchman keep v\pointup{\i}gil.

In vain is your earli\pointup{e}r rising,\Med\\
your going later to r\pointup{e}st,\\
you who toil for the bread y\pointup{o}u eat,\Med\\
when he pours gifts on his beloved while they sl\pointup{u}mber.

Truly sons are a gift from th\pointup{e} Lord,\Med\\
a blessing, the fruit of the w\pointup{o}mb.\\
Indeed the sons \pointup{o}f youth\Med\\
are like arrows in the hand of a w\pointup{a}rrior.

O the happiness of th\pointup{e} man\Med\\
who has filled his quiver with these \pointup{a}rrows!\\
He will have no cause f\pointup{o}r shame\Med\\
when he disputes with his foes in the g\pointup{a}teways.

Glory to the Father and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
and to the Holy Sp\pointup{\i}rit:\\
as it was in the beginning, \pointup{\i}s now,\Med\\
and will be forever. Am\pointup{e}n.
