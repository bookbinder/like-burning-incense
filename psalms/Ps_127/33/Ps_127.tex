\FirstLetter{I}f the Lord does not build th\pointup{e} house,\Med\\
in vain do its build\pointup{e}rs labor;\\
if the Lord does not watch over th\pointup{e} city,\Med\\
in vain does the watchman k\pointup{e}ep vigil.

In vain is your earli\pointup{e}r rising,\Med\\
your going later t\pointup{o} rest,\\
you who toil for the bread y\pointup{o}u eat,\Med\\
when he pours gifts on his beloved while th\pointup{e}y slumber.

Truly sons are a gift from th\pointup{e} Lord,\Med\\
a blessing, the fruit of th\pointup{e} womb.\\
Indeed the sons \pointup{o}f youth\Med\\
are like arrows in the hand of \pointup{a} warrior.

O the happiness of th\pointup{e} man\Med\\
who has filled his quiver with th\pointup{e}se arrows!\\
He will have no cause f\pointup{o}r shame\Med\\
when he disputes with his foes in th\pointup{e} gateways.

Glory to the Father and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginning, \pointup{\i}s now,\Med\\
and will be forever. \pointupl{A}men.
