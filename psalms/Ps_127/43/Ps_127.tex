\FirstLetter{I}f the Lord does not b\pointup{u}ild the house,\Med\\
in vain do its build\pointup{e}rs labor;\\
if the Lord does not watch ov\pointup{e}r the city,\Med\\
in vain does the watchman k\pointup{e}ep vigil.

In vain is your earl\pointup{\i}er rising,\Med\\
your going later t\pointup{o} rest,\\
you who toil for the br\pointup{e}ad you eat,\Med\\
when he pours gifts on his beloved while th\pointup{e}y slumber.

Truly sons are a gift fr\pointup{o}m the Lord,\Med\\
a blessing, the fruit of th\pointup{e} womb.\\
Indeed the s\pointup{o}ns of youth\Med\\
are like arrows in the hand of \pointup{a} warrior.

O the happiness \pointup{o}f the man\Med\\
who has filled his quiver with th\pointup{e}se arrows!\\
He will have no c\pointup{a}use for shame\Med\\
when he disputes with his foes in th\pointup{e} gateways.

Glory to the Father and t\pointup{o} the Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginn\pointup{\i}ng, is now,\Med\\
and will be forever. \pointupl{A}men.
