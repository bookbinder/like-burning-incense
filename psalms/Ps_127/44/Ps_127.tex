\FirstLetter{I}f the Lord does not b\pointup{u}ild the house,\Med\\
in vain do its b\pointup{u}ilders labor;\\
if the Lord does not watch ov\pointup{e}r the city,\Med\\
in vain does the watchm\pointup{a}n keep vigil.

In vain is your earl\pointup{\i}er rising,\Med\\
your going lat\pointup{e}r to rest,\\
you who toil for the br\pointup{e}ad you eat,\Med\\
when he pours gifts on his beloved wh\pointup{\i}le they slumber.

Truly sons are a gift fr\pointup{o}m the Lord,\Med\\
a blessing, the fruit \pointup{o}f the womb.\\
Indeed the s\pointup{o}ns of youth\Med\\
are like arrows in the hand \pointup{o}f a warrior.

O the happiness \pointup{o}f the man\Med\\
who has filled his quiver w\pointup{\i}th these arrows!\\
He will have no c\pointup{a}use for shame\Med\\
when he disputes with his foes \pointup{\i}n the gateways.

Glory to the Father and t\pointup{o} the Son,\Med\\
and to the H\pointup{o}ly Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginn\pointup{\i}ng, is now,\Med\\
and will be forev\pointup{e}r. Amen.
