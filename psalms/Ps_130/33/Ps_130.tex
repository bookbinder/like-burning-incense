\FirstLetter{O}ut of the depths I cry to you, \pointup{O} Lord,\Med\\
    Lord, hear m\pointup{y} voice!\\
O let your ears be \pointup{a}ttentive\Med\\
    to the voice of m\pointup{y} pleading.

If you, O Lord, should mark \pointup{o}ur guilt,\Med\\
    Lord, who would s\pointup{u}rvive?\\
But with you is found f\pointup{o}rgiveness:\Med\\
    for this we r\pointup{e}vere you.

My soul is waiting for th\pointup{e} Lord.\Med\\
    I count on h\pointup{\i}s word.\\
My soul is longing for th\pointup{e} Lord\Med\\
    more than watchman f\pointup{o}r daybreak.\\
Let the watchman count \pointup{o}n daybreak\Med\\
    and Israel on th\pointup{e} Lord.

Because with the Lord there \pointup{\i}s mercy\Med\\
    and fullness of r\pointup{e}demption,\\
Israel indeed he will r\pointup{e}deem\Med\\
    from all its \pointup{\i}niquity.

Glory to the Father and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
    and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginning, \pointup{\i}s now,\Med\\
    and will be for ever. \pointupl{A}men.
