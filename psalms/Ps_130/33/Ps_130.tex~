Psalm 129 (130)
Out of the depths


“He will save his people from their sins” (Mt 1:21).

From the morning watch until night, I have waited trustingly for the Lord.

Out of the depths I cry to you, O Lord,
    Lord, hear my voice!
O let your ears be attentive
    to the voice of my pleading.

If you, O Lord, should mark our guilt,
    Lord, who would survive?
But with you is found forgiveness:
    for this we revere you.

My soul is waiting for the Lord.
    I count on his word.
My soul is longing for the Lord
    more than watchman for daybreak.
Let the watchman count on daybreak
    and Israel on the Lord.

Because with the Lord there is mercy
    and fullness of redemption,
Israel indeed he will redeem
    from all its iniquity.

Glory to the Father and to the Son,
    and to the Holy Spirit:
as it was in the beginning, is now,
    and will be for ever. Amen.
