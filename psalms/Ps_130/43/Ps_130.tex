\FirstLetter{O}ut of the depths I cry to y\pointup{o}u, O Lord,\Med\\
    Lord, hear m\pointup{y} voice!\\
O let your ears b\pointup{e} attentive\Med\\
    to the voice of m\pointup{y} pleading.

If you, O Lord, should m\pointup{a}rk our guilt,\Med\\
    Lord, who would s\pointup{u}rvive?\\
But with you is f\pointup{o}und forgiveness:\Med\\
    for this we r\pointup{e}vere you.

My soul is waiting f\pointup{o}r the Lord.\Med\\
    I count on h\pointup{\i}s word.\\
My soul is longing f\pointup{o}r the Lord\Med\\
    more than watchman f\pointup{o}r daybreak.\\
Let the watchman c\pointup{o}unt on daybreak\Med\\
    and Israel on th\pointup{e} Lord.

Because with the Lord th\pointup{e}re is mercy\Med\\
    and fullness of r\pointup{e}demption,\\
Israel indeed he w\pointup{\i}ll redeem\Med\\
    from all its \pointup{\i}niquity.

Glory to the Father and t\pointup{o} the Son,\Med\\
    and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginn\pointup{\i}ng, is now,\Med\\
    and will be for ever. \pointupl{A}men.
