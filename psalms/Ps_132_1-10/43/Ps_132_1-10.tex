\FirstLetter{O} Lord, rem\pointup{e}mber David\Med\\
    and all the many hardships he \pointup{e}ndured,\\
the oath he swore t\pointup{o} the Lord,\Med\\
    his vow to the Strong One \pointup{o}f Jacob.

‘I will not enter the house wh\pointup{e}re I live\Med\\
    nor go to the bed where \pointup{I} rest.\\
I will give no sleep t\pointup{o} my eyes,\Med\\
    to my eyelids I will give n\pointup{o} slumber\\
till I find a place f\pointup{o}r the Lord,\Med\\
    a dwelling for the Strong One \pointup{o}f Jacob.’

At Ephrata we heard \pointup{o}f the ark;\Med\\
    we found it in the plains \pointup{o}f Yearim.\\
‘Let us go to the place \pointup{o}f his dwelling;\Med\\
    let us go to kneel at h\pointup{\i}s footstool.’

Go up, Lord, to the place \pointup{o}f your rest,\Med\\
    you and the ark of y\pointup{o}ur strength.\\
Your priests shall be cl\pointup{o}thed with holiness;\Med\\
    your faithful shall ring out th\pointup{e}ir joy.\\
For the sake of Dav\pointup{\i}d your servant\Med\\
    do not reject your \pointup{a}nointed.

Glory to the Father and t\pointup{o} the Son,\Med\\
    and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginn\pointup{\i}ng, is now,\Med\\
    and will be for ever. \pointupl{A}men.
