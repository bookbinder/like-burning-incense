O Lord, remember David
    and all the many hardships he endured,
the oath he swore to the Lord,
    his vow to the Strong One of Jacob.

‘I will not enter the house where I live
    nor go to the bed where I rest.
I will give no sleep to my eyes,
    to my eyelids I will give no slumber
till I find a place for the Lord,
    a dwelling for the Strong One of Jacob.’

At Ephrata we heard of the ark;
    we found it in the plains of Yearim.
‘Let us go to the place of his dwelling;
    let us go to kneel at his footstool.’

Go up, Lord, to the place of your rest,
    you and the ark of your strength.
Your priests shall be clothed with holiness;
    your faithful shall ring out their joy.
For the sake of David your servant
    do not reject your anointed.

Glory to the Father and to the Son,
    and to the Holy Spirit:
as it was in the beginning, is now,
    and will be for ever. Amen.
