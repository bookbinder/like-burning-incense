\FirstLetter{T}he Lord swore an oath t\pointup{o} David;\Med\\
    he will not go back on h\pointup{\i}s word:\\
‘A son, the fruit of y\pointup{o}ur body,\Med\\
    will I set upon y\pointup{o}ur throne.

‘If they keep my covenant \pointup{\i}n truth\Med\\
    and my laws that I h\pointup{a}ve taught them,\\
their sons also sh\pointup{a}ll rule\Med\\
    on your throne from age t\pointup{o} age.’

For the Lord has chos\pointup{e}n Sion;\Med\\
    he has desired it for h\pointup{\i}s dwelling:\\
‘This is my resting-place f\pointup{o}r ever;\Med\\
    here have I chosen t\pointup{o} live.

‘I will greatly bless h\pointup{e}r produce,\Med\\
    I will fill her poor w\pointup{\i}th bread.\\
I will clothe her priests with s\pointup{a}lvation\Med\\
    and her faithful shall ring out th\pointup{e}ir joy.

‘There David’s stock w\pointup{\i}ll flower;\Med\\
    I will prepare a lamp for my \pointup{a}nointed.\\
I will cover his enemies w\pointup{\i}th shame\Med\\
    but on him my crown sh\pointup{a}ll shine.’

Glory to the Father and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
    and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginning, \pointup{\i}s now,\Med\\
    and will be for ever. \pointupl{A}men.
