The Lord swore an oath to David;
    he will not go back on his word:
‘A son, the fruit of your body,
    will I set upon your throne.

‘If they keep my covenant in truth
    and my laws that I have taught them,
their sons also shall rule
    on your throne from age to age.’

For the Lord has chosen Sion;
    he has desired it for his dwelling:
‘This is my resting-place for ever;
    here have I chosen to live.

‘I will greatly bless her produce,
    I will fill her poor with bread.
I will clothe her priests with salvation
    and her faithful shall ring out their joy.

‘There David’s stock will flower;
    I will prepare a lamp for my anointed.
I will cover his enemies with shame
    but on him my crown shall shine.’

Glory to the Father and to the Son,
    and to the Holy Spirit:
as it was in the beginning, is now,
    and will be for ever. Amen.
