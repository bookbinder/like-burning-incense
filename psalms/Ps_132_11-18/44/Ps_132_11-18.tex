\FirstLetter{T}he Lord swore an \pointup{o}ath to David;\Med\\
    he will not go back \pointup{o}n his word:\\
‘A son, the fruit \pointup{o}f your body,\Med\\
    will I set up\pointup{o}n your throne.

‘If they keep my coven\pointup{a}nt in truth\Med\\
    and my laws that I h\pointup{a}ve taught them,\\
their sons als\pointup{o} shall rule\Med\\
    on your throne from \pointup{a}ge to age.’

For the Lord has ch\pointup{o}sen Sion;\Med\\
    he has desired it f\pointup{o}r his dwelling:\\
‘This is my resting-pl\pointup{a}ce for ever;\Med\\
    here have I chos\pointup{e}n to live.

‘I will greatly bl\pointup{e}ss her produce,\Med\\
    I will fill her p\pointup{o}or with bread.\\
I will clothe her priests w\pointup{\i}th salvation\Med\\
    and her faithful shall ring \pointup{o}ut their joy.

‘There David’s st\pointup{o}ck will flower;\Med\\
    I will prepare a lamp for m\pointup{y} anointed.\\
I will cover his enem\pointup{\i}es with shame\Med\\
    but on him my cr\pointup{o}wn shall shine.’

Glory to the Father and t\pointup{o} the Son,\Med\\
    and to the H\pointup{o}ly Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginn\pointup{\i}ng, is now,\Med\\
    and will be for ev\pointup{e}r. Amen.
