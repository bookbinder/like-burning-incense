Psalm 134
Evening Prayer in the Temple
“Praise our God, all you his servants, and all who revere him, both great and small” (Rev 19:5).


O come, bless the Lord,
    all you who serve the Lord,
who stand in the house of the Lord,
    in the courts of the house of our God.

Lift up your hands to the holy place
    and bless the Lord through the night.

May the Lord bless you from Sion,
    he who made both heaven and earth.

Glory to the Father and to the Son,
    and to the Holy Spirit:
as it was in the beginning, is now,
    and will be for ever. Amen.
