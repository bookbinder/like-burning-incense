\FirstLetter{P}raise the name of th\pointup{e} Lord,\Med\\
praise him, servants of th\pointup{e} Lord,\\
who stand in the house of th\pointup{e} Lord\Med\\
in the courts of the house of \pointup{o}ur God.

Praise the Lord for the Lord \pointup{\i}s good.\Med\\
Sing a psalm to his name for he \pointup{\i}s loving.\\
For the Lord has chosen Jacob for h\pointup{\i}mself\Med\\
and Israel for his own p\pointup{o}ssession.

For I know the Lord \pointup{\i}s great,\Med\\
that our Lord is high above \pointup{a}ll gods.\\
The Lord does whatever h\pointup{e} wills,\Med\\
in heaven, on earth, in th\pointup{e} seas.

He summons clouds from the ends of the \pointup{e}arth;\Flex\\
makes lightning produce th\pointup{e} rain;\Med\\
from his treasuries he sends forth th\pointup{e} wind.

The first-born of the Egyptians h\pointup{e} smote,\Med\\
of man and beast \pointup{a}like.\\
Signs and wonders he w\pointup{o}rked\Flex\\
in the midst of your land, \pointup{O} Egypt,\Med\\
against Pharaoh and all h\pointup{\i}s servants.

Nations in their greatness h\pointup{e} struck\Med\\
and kings in their splendor h\pointup{e} slew.\\
Sihon, king of the Amor\pointup{\i}tes,\Flex\\
Og, the king \pointup{o}f Bashan,\Med\\
and all the kingdoms \pointup{o}f Canaan.\\
He let Israel inherit th\pointup{e}ir land;\Med\\
on his people their land he b\pointup{e}stowed.

Glory to the Father and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginning, \pointup{\i}s now,\Med\\
and will be forever. \pointupl{A}men.
