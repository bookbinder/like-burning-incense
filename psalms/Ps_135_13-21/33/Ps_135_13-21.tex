\FirstLetter{L}ord, your name stands f\pointup{o}r ever,\Med\\
unforgotten from age t\pointup{o} age:\\
for the Lord does justice for h\pointup{\i}s people;\Med\\
the Lord takes pity on h\pointup{\i}s servants.

Pagan idols are silver \pointup{a}nd gold,\Med\\
the work of hum\pointup{a}n hands.\\
They have mouths but they cann\pointup{o}t speak;\Med\\
they have eyes but they cann\pointup{o}t see.

They have ears but they cann\pointup{o}t hear;\Med\\
there is never a breath on th\pointup{e}ir lips.\\
Their makers will become l\pointup{\i}ke them\Med\\
and so will all who trust \pointup{\i}n them!

Sons of Israel, bless th\pointup{e} Lord!\Med\\
Sons of Aaron, bless th\pointup{e} Lord!\\
Sons of Levi, bless th\pointup{e} Lord!\Med\\
You who fear him, bless th\pointup{e} Lord!

From Zion may the Lord b\pointup{e} blessed,\Med\\
he who dwells in J\pointup{e}rusalem!

Glory to the Father and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginning, \pointup{\i}s now,\Med\\
and will be forever. \pointupl{A}men.
