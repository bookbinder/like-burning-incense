\FirstLetter{L}ord, your name st\pointup{a}nds for ever,\Med\\
unforgotten from age t\pointup{o} age:\\
for the Lord does justice f\pointup{o}r his people;\Med\\
the Lord takes pity on h\pointup{\i}s servants.

Pagan idols are silv\pointup{e}r and gold,\Med\\
the work of hum\pointup{a}n hands.\\
They have mouths but they c\pointup{a}nnot speak;\Med\\
they have eyes but they cann\pointup{o}t see.

They have ears but they c\pointup{a}nnot hear;\Med\\
there is never a breath on th\pointup{e}ir lips.\\
Their makers will bec\pointup{o}me like them\Med\\
and so will all who trust \pointup{\i}n them!

Sons of Israel, bl\pointup{e}ss the Lord!\Med\\
Sons of Aaron, bless th\pointup{e} Lord!\\
Sons of Levi, bl\pointup{e}ss the Lord!\Med\\
You who fear him, bless th\pointup{e} Lord!

From Zion may the L\pointup{o}rd be blessed,\Med\\
he who dwells in J\pointup{e}rusalem!

Glory to the Father and t\pointup{o} the Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginn\pointup{\i}ng, is now,\Med\\
and will be forever. \pointupl{A}men.
