Psalm 136: 1-9
A paschal hymn


“To tell of the works of the Lord is to give praise” (Cassiodorus).

Give thanks to the Lord, for his great love is without end.

O give thanks to the Lord for he is good,
    for his love endures for ever.
Give thanks to the God of gods
    for his love endures for ever.
Give thanks to the Lord of lords,
    for his love endures for ever;

who alone has wrought marvellous works,
    for his love endures for ever;
whose wisdom it was made the skies,
    for his love endures for ever;
who fixed the earth firmly on the seas,
    for his love endures for ever.

It was he who made the great lights,
    for his love endures for ever;
the sun to rule in the day,
    for his love endures for ever;
the moon and stars in the night,
    for his love endures for ever.

Glory to the Father and to the Son,
    and to the Holy Spirit:
as it was in the beginning, is now,
    and will be for ever. Amen.
