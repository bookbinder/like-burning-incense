Psalm 136:10-26

Great and wonderful are your deeds, Lord God the Almighty.

The first-born of the Egyptians he smote,
    for his love endures for ever.
He brought Israel out from their midst,
    for his love endures for ever;
arm outstretched, with power in his hand,
    for his love endures for ever.

He divided the Red Sea in two,
    for his love endures for ever;
he made Israel pass through the midst,
    for his love endures for ever;
he flung Pharaoh and his force in the sea,
    for his love endures for ever.

Through the desert his people he led,
    for his love endures for ever.
Nations in their greatness he struck,
    for his love endures for ever.
Kings in their splendour he slew,
    for his love endures for ever.

Sihon, king of the Amorites,
    for his love endures for ever;
and Og, the king of Bashan,
    for his love endures for ever.

He let Israel inherit their land,
    for his love endures for ever.
On his servant their land he bestowed,
    for his love endures for ever.
He remembered us in our distress,
    for his love endures for ever.

And he snatched us away from our foes,
    for his love endures for ever.
He gives food to all living things,
    for his love endures for ever.
To the God of heaven give thanks,
    for his love endures for ever.

Glory to the Father and to the Son,
    and to the Holy Spirit:
as it was in the beginning, is now,
    and will be for ever. Amen.
