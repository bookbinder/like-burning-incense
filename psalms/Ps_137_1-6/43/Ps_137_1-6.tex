\FirstLetter{B}y the rivers of Babyl\pointup{o}n\Flex\\
    there we s\pointup{a}t and wept,\Med\\
    remember\pointup{\i}ng Sion;\\
on the popl\pointup{a}rs that grew there\Med\\
    we hung up \pointup{o}ur harps.

For it was there that they asked \pointup{u}s,\Flex\\
    our capt\pointup{o}rs, for songs,\Med\\
    our oppressors, f\pointup{o}r joy.\\
‘Sing to \pointup{u}s,’ they said,\Med\\
    ‘one of Si\pointup{o}n’s songs.’

O how could we s\pointup{\i}ng\Flex\\
    the song \pointup{o}f the Lord\Med\\
    on ali\pointup{e}n soil?\\
If I forget y\pointup{o}u, Jerusalem,\Med\\
    let my right h\pointup{a}nd wither!

O let my t\pointup{o}ngue\Flex\\
    cleave t\pointup{o} my mouth\Med\\
    if I remember y\pointup{o}u not,\\
if I prize n\pointup{o}t Jerusalem\Med\\
    above all m\pointup{y} joys!

Glory to the Father and t\pointup{o} the Son,\Med\\
    and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginn\pointup{\i}ng, is now,\Med\\
    and will be for ever. \pointupl{A}men.
