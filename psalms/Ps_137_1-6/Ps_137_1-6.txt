Psalm 137
By the rivers of Babylon


“This bodily captivity of the people must be understood as pointing to their spiritual captivity” (St Hilary).

If I forget you, Jerusalem, let my right hand wither.

By the rivers of Babylon
    there we sat and wept,
    remembering Sion;
on the poplars that grew there
    we hung up our harps.

For it was there that they asked us,
    our captors, for songs,
    our oppressors, for joy.
‘Sing to us,’ they said,
    ‘one of Sion’s songs.’

O how could we sing
    the song of the Lord
    on alien soil?
If I forget you, Jerusalem,
    let my right hand wither!

O let my tongue
    cleave to my mouth
    if I remember you not,
if I prize not Jerusalem
    above all my joys!

Glory to the Father and to the Son,
    and to the Holy Spirit:
as it was in the beginning, is now,
    and will be for ever. Amen.
