\FirstLetter{I} thank you, Lord, with all m\pointup{y} heart:\Med\\
you have heard the words of m\pointup{y} mouth.\\
In the presence of the angels I w\pointup{\i}ll bless you.\Med\\
I will adore before your hol\pointup{y} temple.

I thank you for your faithfulness \pointup{a}nd love,\Med\\
which excel all we ever knew \pointup{o}f you.\\
On the day I called, y\pointup{o}u answered;\Med\\
you increased the strength of m\pointup{y} soul.

All earth’s kings sh\pointup{a}ll thank you\Med\\
when they hear the words of y\pointup{o}ur mouth.\\
They shall sing of the L\pointup{o}rd’s ways:\Med\\
‘How great is the glory of th\pointup{e} Lord!’

The Lord is high yet he looks on th\pointup{e} lowly\Med\\
and the haughty he knows from \pointup{a}far.\\
Though I walk in the midst of \pointup{a}ffliction\Med\\
you give me life and frustrate m\pointup{y} foes.

You stretch out your hand \pointup{a}nd save me,\Med\\
your hand will do all things f\pointup{o}r me.\\
Your love, O Lord, is \pointup{e}ternal,\Med\\
discard not the work of y\pointup{o}ur hands.

Glory to the Father and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginning, \pointup{\i}s now,\Med\\
and will be for ever. \pointupl{A}men.
