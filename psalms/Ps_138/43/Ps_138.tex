\FirstLetter{I} thank you, Lord, with \pointup{a}ll my heart:\Med\\
you have heard the words of m\pointup{y} mouth.\\
In the presence of the angels \pointup{I} will bless you.\Med\\
I will adore before your hol\pointup{y} temple.

I thank you for your faithfuln\pointup{e}ss and love,\Med\\
which excel all we ever knew \pointup{o}f you.\\
On the day I c\pointup{a}lled, you answered;\Med\\
you increased the strength of m\pointup{y} soul.

All earth’s k\pointup{\i}ngs shall thank you\Med\\
when they hear the words of y\pointup{o}ur mouth.\\
They shall sing of th\pointup{e} Lord’s ways:\Med\\
‘How great is the glory of th\pointup{e} Lord!’

The Lord is high yet he looks \pointup{o}n the lowly\Med\\
and the haughty he knows from \pointup{a}far.\\
Though I walk in the midst \pointup{o}f affliction\Med\\
you give me life and frustrate m\pointup{y} foes.

You stretch out your h\pointup{a}nd and save me,\Med\\
your hand will do all things f\pointup{o}r me.\\
Your love, O Lord, \pointup{\i}s eternal,\Med\\
discard not the work of y\pointup{o}ur hands.

Glory to the Father and t\pointup{o} the Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginn\pointup{\i}ng, is now,\Med\\
and will be for ever. \pointupl{A}men.
