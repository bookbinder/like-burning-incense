\FirstLetter{O} Lord, you search me and you know m\pointup{e},\Flex\\
you know my resting and m\pointup{y} rising,\Med\\
you discern my purpose from \pointup{a}far.\\
You mark when I walk or l\pointup{\i}e down,\Med\\
all my ways lie open t\pointup{o} you.

Before ever a word is on m\pointup{y} tongue\Med\\
you know it, O Lord, through \pointup{a}nd through.\\
Behind and before you b\pointup{e}siege me,\Med\\
your hand ever laid \pointup{u}pon me.\\
Too wonderful for me th\pointup{\i}s knowledge,\Med\\
too high, beyond m\pointup{y} reach.

O where can I go from y\pointup{o}ur spirit,\Med\\
or where can I flee from y\pointup{o}ur face?\\
If I climb the heavens, you \pointup{a}re there.\Med\\
If I lie in the grave, you \pointup{a}re there.

If I take the wings of th\pointup{e} dawn\Med\\
and dwell at the sea’s furth\pointup{e}st end,\\
even there your hand w\pointup{o}uld lead me,\Med\\
your right hand would hold m\pointup{e} fast.

If I say: ‘Let the darkn\pointup{e}ss hide me\Med\\
and the light around me b\pointup{e} night,’\\
even darkness is not dark f\pointup{o}r you\Med\\
and the night is as clear as th\pointup{e} day.

Glory to the Father and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginning, \pointup{\i}s now,\Med\\
and will be for ever. \pointupl{A}men.
