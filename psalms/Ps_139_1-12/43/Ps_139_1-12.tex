\FirstLetter{O} Lord, you search me and you know m\pointup{e},\Flex\\
you know my resting \pointup{a}nd my rising,\Med\\
you discern my purpose from \pointup{a}far.\\
You mark when I walk \pointup{o}r lie down,\Med\\
all my ways lie open t\pointup{o} you.

Before ever a word is \pointup{o}n my tongue\Med\\
you know it, O Lord, through \pointup{a}nd through.\\
Behind and before y\pointup{o}u besiege me,\Med\\
your hand ever laid \pointup{u}pon me.\\
Too wonderful for m\pointup{e} this knowledge,\Med\\
too high, beyond m\pointup{y} reach.

O where can I go fr\pointup{o}m your spirit,\Med\\
or where can I flee from y\pointup{o}ur face?\\
If I climb the heavens, y\pointup{o}u are there.\Med\\
If I lie in the grave, you \pointup{a}re there.

If I take the wings \pointup{o}f the dawn\Med\\
and dwell at the sea’s furth\pointup{e}st end,\\
even there your h\pointup{a}nd would lead me,\Med\\
your right hand would hold m\pointup{e} fast.

If I say: ‘Let the d\pointup{a}rkness hide me\Med\\
and the light around me b\pointup{e} night,’\\
even darkness is not d\pointup{a}rk for you\Med\\
and the night is as clear as th\pointup{e} day.

Glory to the Father and t\pointup{o} the Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginn\pointup{\i}ng, is now,\Med\\
and will be for ever. \pointupl{A}men.
