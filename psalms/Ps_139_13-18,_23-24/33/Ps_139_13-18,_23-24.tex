\FirstLetter{F}or it was you who created m\pointup{y} being,\Med\\
knit me together in my moth\pointup{e}râ€™s womb.\\
I thank you for the wonder of m\pointup{y} being,\Med\\
for the wonders of all your cr\pointup{e}ation.

Already you knew m\pointup{y} soul,\Med\\
my body held no secret fr\pointup{o}m you\\
when I was being fashioned \pointup{\i}n secret\Med\\
and moulded in the depths of th\pointup{e} earth.

Your eyes saw all m\pointup{y} actions,\Med\\
they were all of them written in y\pointup{o}ur book;\\
every one of my days was d\pointup{e}creed\Med\\
before one of them came int\pointup{o} being.

To me, how mysterious y\pointup{o}ur thoughts,\Med\\
the sum of them not to b\pointup{e} numbered!\\
If I count them, they are more than th\pointup{e} sand;\Med\\
to finish, I must be eternal, l\pointup{\i}ke you.

O search me, God, and know m\pointup{y} heart.\Med\\
O test me and know m\pointup{y} thoughts.\\
See that I follow not the wr\pointup{o}ng path\Med\\
and lead me in the path of life \pointup{e}ternal.

Glory to the Father and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginning, \pointup{\i}s now,\Med\\
and will be for ever. \pointupl{A}men.
