\FirstLetter{F}or it was you who creat\pointup{e}d my being,\Med\\
knit me together in my moth\pointup{e}râ€™s womb.\\
I thank you for the wonder \pointup{o}f my being,\Med\\
for the wonders of all your cr\pointup{e}ation.

Already you kn\pointup{e}w my soul,\Med\\
my body held no secret fr\pointup{o}m you\\
when I was being fash\pointup{\i}oned in secret\Med\\
and moulded in the depths of th\pointup{e} earth.

Your eyes saw \pointup{a}ll my actions,\Med\\
they were all of them written in y\pointup{o}ur book;\\
every one of my days w\pointup{a}s decreed\Med\\
before one of them came int\pointup{o} being.

To me, how mysteri\pointup{o}us your thoughts,\Med\\
the sum of them not to b\pointup{e} numbered!\\
If I count them, they are more th\pointup{a}n the sand;\Med\\
to finish, I must be eternal, l\pointup{\i}ke you.

O search me, God, and kn\pointup{o}w my heart.\Med\\
O test me and know m\pointup{y} thoughts.\\
See that I follow not th\pointup{e} wrong path\Med\\
and lead me in the path of life \pointup{e}ternal.

Glory to the Father and t\pointup{o} the Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginn\pointup{\i}ng, is now,\Med\\
and will be for ever. \pointupl{A}men.
