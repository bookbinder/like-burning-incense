\begin{verse}%%[\versewidth]
I have called to you, Lord; hasten to help me!\\
    Hear my voice when I cry to you.\\
Let my prayer arise before you like incense,\\
    the raising of my hands like an evening oblation.

Set, O Lord, a guard over my mouth;\\
    keep watch, O Lord, at the door of my lips!\\
Do not turn my heart to things that are wrong,\\
    to evil deeds with men who are sinners.

Never allow me to share in their feasting.\\
    If a good man strikes or reproves me it is kindness;\\
but let the oil of the wicked not anoint my head.\\
    Let my prayer be ever against their malice.

Their princes were thrown down by the side of the rock;\\
    then they understood that my words were kind.\\
As a millstone is shattered to pieces on the ground,\\
    so their bones were strewn at the mouth of the grave.

To you, Lord God, my eyes are turned:\\
    in you I take refuge; spare my soul!\\
From the trap they have laid for me keep me safe:\\
    keep me from the snares of those who do evil.

Glory to the Father and to the Son,\\
    and to the Holy Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginning, is now,\\
    and will be for ever. Amen.
\end{verse}
