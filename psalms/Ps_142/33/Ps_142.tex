\FirstLetter{W}ith all my voice I cry to th\pointup{e} Lord,\Med\\
    with all my voice I entreat th\pointup{e} Lord.\\
I pour out my trouble b\pointup{e}fore him;\Med\\
    I tell him all my d\pointup{\i}stress\\
while my spirit faints w\pointup{\i}thin me.\Med\\
    But you, O Lord, know m\pointup{y} path.

On the way where I sh\pointup{a}ll walk\Med\\
    they have hidden a snare to \pointup{e}ntrap me.\\
Look on my right \pointup{a}nd see:\Med\\
    there is no one who takes m\pointup{y} part.\\
I have no means of \pointup{e}scape,\Med\\
    not one who cares for m\pointup{y} soul.

I cry to you, O L\pointup{o}rd.\Flex\\
    I have said: ‘You are m\pointup{y} refuge\Med\\
    all I have in the land of th\pointup{e} living.’\\
Listen, then, to m\pointup{y} cry\Med\\
    for I am in the depths of d\pointup{\i}stress.

Rescue me from those who p\pointup{u}rsue me\Med\\
    for they are stronger th\pointup{a}n I.\\
Bring my soul out of th\pointup{\i}s prison\Med\\
    and then I shall praise y\pointup{o}ur name.\\
Around me the just will \pointup{a}ssemble\Med\\
    because of your goodness t\pointup{o} me.

Glory to the Father and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
    and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginning, \pointup{\i}s now,\Med\\
    and will be for ever. \pointupl{A}men.
