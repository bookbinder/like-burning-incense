\FirstLetter{W}ith all my voice I cry t\pointup{o} the Lord,\Med\\
    with all my voice I entreat th\pointup{e} Lord.\\
I pour out my troubl\pointup{e} before him;\Med\\
    I tell him all my d\pointup{\i}stress\\
while my spirit f\pointup{a}ints within me.\Med\\
    But you, O Lord, know m\pointup{y} path.

On the way where \pointup{I} shall walk\Med\\
    they have hidden a snare to \pointup{e}ntrap me.\\
Look on my r\pointup{\i}ght and see:\Med\\
    there is no one who takes m\pointup{y} part.\\
I have no means \pointup{o}f escape,\Med\\
    not one who cares for m\pointup{y} soul.

I cry to you, O L\pointup{o}rd.\Flex\\
    I have said: ‘You \pointup{a}re my refuge\Med\\
    all I have in the land of th\pointup{e} living.’\\
Listen, then, t\pointup{o} my cry\Med\\
    for I am in the depths of d\pointup{\i}stress.

Rescue me from those wh\pointup{o} pursue me\Med\\
    for they are stronger th\pointup{a}n I.\\
Bring my soul out \pointup{o}f this prison\Med\\
    and then I shall praise y\pointup{o}ur name.\\
Around me the just w\pointup{\i}ll assemble\Med\\
    because of your goodness t\pointup{o} me.

Glory to the Father and t\pointup{o} the Son,\Med\\
    and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginn\pointup{\i}ng, is now,\Med\\
    and will be for ever. \pointupl{A}men.
