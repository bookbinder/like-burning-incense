With all my voice I cry to the Lord,
    with all my voice I entreat the Lord.
I pour out my trouble before him;
    I tell him all my distress
while my spirit faints within me.
    But you, O Lord, know my path.

On the way where I shall walk
    they have hidden a snare to entrap me.
Look on my right and see:
    there is no one who takes my part.
I have no means of escape,
    not one who cares for my soul.

I cry to you, O Lord.
    I have said: ‘You are my refuge
    all I have in the land of the living.’
Listen, then, to my cry
    for I am in the depths of distress.

Rescue me from those who pursue me
    for they are stronger than I.
Bring my soul out of this prison
    and then I shall praise your name.
Around me the just will assemble
    because of your goodness to me.

Glory to the Father and to the Son,
    and to the Holy Spirit:
as it was in the beginning, is now,
    and will be for ever. Amen.
