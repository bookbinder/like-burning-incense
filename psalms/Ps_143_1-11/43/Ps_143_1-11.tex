    \FirstLetter{L}ord, listen t\pointup{o} my prayer:\Med\\
    turn your ear to my \pointup{a}ppeal.\\
    You are faithful, you are just; give answ\pointup{e}r.\Flex\\
    Do not call your serv\pointup{a}nt to judgement\\
    for no one is just in y\pointup{o}ur sight.

    The enemy purs\pointup{u}es my soul;\Med\\
    he has crushed my life to th\pointup{e} ground;\\
    he has made me dw\pointup{e}ll in darkness\Med\\
    like the dead, long f\pointup{o}rgotten.\\
    Therefore my sp\pointup{\i}rit fails;\Med\\
    my heart is numb w\pointup{\i}thin me.

    I remember the days th\pointup{a}t are past:\Med\\
    I ponder all y\pointup{o}ur works.\\
    I muse on what your hand has wr\pointup{o}ught\Flex\\
    and to you I stretch \pointup{o}ut my hands.\Med\\
    Like a parched land my soul thirsts f\pointup{o}r you.

    Lord, make h\pointup{a}ste and answer;\Med\\
    for my spirit fails w\pointup{\i}thin me.\\
    Do not h\pointup{\i}de your face\Med\\
    lest I become like those in th\pointup{e} grave.

    In the morning let me kn\pointup{o}w your love\Med\\
    for I put my trust \pointup{\i}n you.\\
    Make me know the way \pointup{I} should walk:\Med\\
    to you I lift up m\pointup{y} soul.

    Rescue me, Lord, fr\pointup{o}m my enemies;\Med\\
    I have fled to you f\pointup{o}r refuge.\\
    Teach me to d\pointup{o} your will\Med\\
    for you, O Lord, are m\pointup{y} God.\\
    Let your good sp\pointup{\i}rit guide me\Med\\
    in ways that are level \pointup{a}nd smooth.

    For your nameâ€™s sake, Lord, s\pointup{a}ve my life;\Med\\
    in your justice save my soul from d\pointup{\i}stress.

    Glory to the Father and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
    and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
    as it was in the beginn\pointup{\i}ng, is now,\Med\\
    and will be for ever. \pointupl{A}men.
