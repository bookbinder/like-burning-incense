\FirstLetter{B}lessed be the Lord, my r\pointup{o}ck,\Flex\\
who trains my arms f\pointup{o}r battle,\Med\\
who prepares my hands f\pointup{o}r war.

He is my love, m\pointup{y} fortress;\Med\\
he is my stronghold, m\pointup{y} saviour\\
my shield, my place \pointup{o}f refuge.\Med\\
He brings peoples under m\pointup{y} rule.

Lord, what is man that you care f\pointup{o}r him,\Med\\
mortal man, that you keep him \pointup{\i}n mind;\\
man, who is merely \pointup{a} breath\Med\\
whose life fades like \pointup{a} shadow?

Lower your heavens and c\pointup{o}me down;\Med\\
touch the mountains; wreathe them \pointup{\i}n smoke.\\
Flash your lightnings; rout th\pointup{e} foe,\Med\\
shoot your arrows and put them t\pointup{o} flight.

Reach down from heaven \pointup{a}nd save me;\Med\\
draw me out from the might\pointup{y} waters,\\
from the hands of alien f\pointup{o}es\Flex\\
whose mouths are filled w\pointup{\i}th lies,\Med\\
whose hands are raised \pointup{\i}n perjury.

To you, O God, will I sing a n\pointup{e}w song;\Med\\
I will play on the ten-str\pointup{\i}nged harp\\
to you who give kings th\pointup{e}ir victory,\Med\\
who set David your serv\pointup{a}nt free.

Glory to the Father and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginning, \pointup{\i}s now,\Med\\
and will be for ever. \pointupl{A}men.
