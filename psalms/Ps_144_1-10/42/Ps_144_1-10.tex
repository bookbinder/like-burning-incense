\FirstLetter{B}lessed be the Lord, my r\pointup{o}ck,\Flex\\
who trains my \pointup{a}rms for battle,\Med\\
who prepares my hands for w\pointup{a}r.

He is my l\pointup{o}ve, my fortress;\Med\\
he is my stronghold, my s\pointup{a}viour\\
my shield, my pl\pointup{a}ce of refuge.\Med\\
He brings peoples under my r\pointup{u}le.

Lord, what is man that you c\pointup{a}re for him,\Med\\
mortal man, that you keep him in m\pointup{\i}nd;\\
man, who is merel\pointup{y} a breath\Med\\
whose life fades like a sh\pointup{a}dow?

Lower your heavens \pointup{a}nd come down;\Med\\
touch the mountains; wreathe them in sm\pointup{o}ke.\\
Flash your lightnings; r\pointup{o}ut the foe,\Med\\
shoot your arrows and put them to fl\pointup{\i}ght.

Reach down from heav\pointup{e}n and save me;\Med\\
draw me out from the mighty w\pointup{a}ters,\\
from the hands of alien f\pointup{o}es\Flex\\
whose mouths are f\pointup{\i}lled with lies,\Med\\
whose hands are raised in p\pointup{e}rjury.

To you, O God, will I sing \pointup{a} new song;\Med\\
I will play on the ten-stringed h\pointup{a}rp\\
to you who give k\pointup{\i}ngs their victory,\Med\\
who set David your servant fr\pointup{e}e.

Glory to the Father and t\pointup{o} the Son,\Med\\
and to the Holy Sp\pointup{\i}rit:\\
as it was in the beginn\pointup{\i}ng, is now,\Med\\
and will be for ever. Am\pointup{e}n.
