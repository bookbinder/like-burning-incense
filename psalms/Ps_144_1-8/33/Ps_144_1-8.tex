\FirstLetter{B}lessed be the Lord, my r\pointup{o}ck,\Flex\\
    who trains my arms f\pointup{o}r battle,\Med\\
    who prepares my hands f\pointup{o}r war.

He is my love, m\pointup{y} fortress;\Med\\
    he is my stronghold, m\pointup{y} saviour\\
my shield, my place \pointup{o}f refuge.\Med\\
    He brings peoples under m\pointup{y} rule.

Lord, what is man that you care f\pointup{o}r him,\Med\\
    mortal man, that you keep him \pointup{\i}n mind;\\
man, who is merely \pointup{a} breath\Med\\
    whose life fades like \pointup{a} shadow?

Lower your heavens and c\pointup{o}me down;\Med\\
    touch the mountains; wreathe them \pointup{\i}n smoke.\\
Flash your lightnings; rout th\pointup{e} foe,\Med\\
    shoot your arrows and put them t\pointup{o} flight.

Reach down from heaven and save m\pointup{e};\Flex\\
    draw me out from the might\pointup{y} waters,\Med\\
    from the hands of ali\pointup{e}n foes\\
whose mouths are filled w\pointup{\i}th lies,\Med\\
    whose hands are raised \pointup{\i}n perjury.

Glory to the Father and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
    and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginning, \pointup{\i}s now,\Med\\
    and will be for ever. \pointupl{A}men.
