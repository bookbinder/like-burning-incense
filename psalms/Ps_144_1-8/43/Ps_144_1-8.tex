\FirstLetter{B}lessed be the Lord, my r\pointup{o}ck,\Flex\\
    who trains my \pointup{a}rms for battle,\Med\\
    who prepares my hands f\pointup{o}r war.

He is my l\pointup{o}ve, my fortress;\Med\\
    he is my stronghold, m\pointup{y} saviour\\
my shield, my pl\pointup{a}ce of refuge.\Med\\
    He brings peoples under m\pointup{y} rule.

Lord, what is man that you c\pointup{a}re for him,\Med\\
    mortal man, that you keep him \pointup{\i}n mind;\\
man, who is merel\pointup{y} a breath\Med\\
    whose life fades like \pointup{a} shadow?

Lower your heavens \pointup{a}nd come down;\Med\\
    touch the mountains; wreathe them \pointup{\i}n smoke.\\
Flash your lightnings; r\pointup{o}ut the foe,\Med\\
    shoot your arrows and put them t\pointup{o} flight.

Reach down from heaven and save m\pointup{e};\Flex\\
    draw me out from the m\pointup{\i}ghty waters,\Med\\
    from the hands of ali\pointup{e}n foes\\
whose mouths are f\pointup{\i}lled with lies,\Med\\
    whose hands are raised \pointup{\i}n perjury.

Glory to the Father and t\pointup{o} the Son,\Med\\
    and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginn\pointup{\i}ng, is now,\Med\\
    and will be for ever. \pointupl{A}men.
