Psalm 144:1-8
For victory and peace


“I can do all things with the help of the One who gives me strength” (Phil 4:13).

To you, O Lord, I lift up my soul; come and rescue me, for you are my refuge and my strength.

Blessed be the Lord, my rock,
    who trains my arms for battle,
    who prepares my hands for war.

He is my love, my fortress;
    he is my stronghold, my saviour
my shield, my place of refuge.
    He brings peoples under my rule.

Lord, what is man that you care for him,
    mortal man, that you keep him in mind;
man, who is merely a breath
    whose life fades like a shadow?

Lower your heavens and come down;
    touch the mountains; wreathe them in smoke.
Flash your lightnings; rout the foe,
    shoot your arrows and put them to flight.

Reach down from heaven and save me;
    draw me out from the mighty waters,
    from the hands of alien foes
whose mouths are filled with lies,
    whose hands are raised in perjury.

Glory to the Father and to the Son,
    and to the Holy Spirit:
as it was in the beginning, is now,
    and will be for ever. Amen.
