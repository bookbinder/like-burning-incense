\FirstLetter{T}o you, O God, will I sing a n\pointup{e}w song;\Med\\
I will play on the ten-str\pointup{\i}nged harp\\
to you who give kings th\pointup{e}ir victory,\Med\\
who set David your serv\pointup{a}nt free.

You set him free from the ev\pointup{\i}l sword;\Med\\
you rescued him from ali\pointup{e}n foes\\
whose mouths were filled w\pointup{\i}th lies,\Med\\
whose hands were raised \pointup{\i}n perjury.

Let our sons then flourish l\pointup{\i}ke saplings\Med\\
grown tall and strong from th\pointup{e}ir youth,\\
our daughters graceful \pointup{a}s columns,\Med\\
adorned as though for \pointup{a} palace.

Let our barns be filled to ov\pointup{e}rflowing\Med\\
with crops of ev\pointup{e}ry kind;\\
our sheep increasing by thous\pointup{a}nds,\Flex\\
myriads of sheep in \pointup{o}ur fields,\Med\\
our cattle heavy w\pointup{\i}th young,

no ruined wall, n\pointup{o} exile,\Med\\
no sound of weeping in \pointup{o}ur streets.\\
Happy the people with s\pointup{u}ch blessings;\Med\\
happy the people whose God is th\pointup{e} Lord.

Glory to the Father and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginning, \pointup{\i}s now,\Med\\
and will be for ever. \pointupl{A}men.
