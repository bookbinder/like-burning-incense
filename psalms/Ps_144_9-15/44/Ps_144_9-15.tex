\FirstLetter{T}o you, O God, will I sing \pointup{a} new song;\Med\\
I will play on the t\pointup{e}n-stringed harp\\
to you who give k\pointup{\i}ngs their victory,\Med\\
who set David your s\pointup{e}rvant free.

You set him free from the \pointup{e}vil sword;\Med\\
you rescued him from \pointup{a}lien foes\\
whose mouths were f\pointup{\i}lled with lies,\Med\\
whose hands were r\pointup{a}ised in perjury.

Let our sons then flour\pointup{\i}sh like saplings\Med\\
grown tall and strong fr\pointup{o}m their youth,\\
our daughters gracef\pointup{u}l as columns,\Med\\
adorned as though f\pointup{o}r a palace.

Let our barns be filled to \pointup{o}verflowing\Med\\
with crops of \pointup{e}very kind;\\
our sheep increasing by thous\pointup{a}nds,\Flex\\
myriads of sheep \pointup{\i}n our fields,\Med\\
our cattle heav\pointup{y} with young,

no ruined w\pointup{a}ll, no exile,\Med\\
no sound of weeping \pointup{\i}n our streets.\\
Happy the people w\pointup{\i}th such blessings;\Med\\
happy the people whose God \pointup{\i}s the Lord.

Glory to the Father and t\pointup{o} the Son,\Med\\
and to the H\pointup{o}ly Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginn\pointup{\i}ng, is now,\Med\\
and will be for ev\pointup{e}r. Amen.
