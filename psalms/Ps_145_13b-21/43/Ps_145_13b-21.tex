and loving in all h\pointup{\i}s deeds.\\
The Lord supports \pointup{a}ll who fall\Med\\
and raises all who are b\pointup{o}wed down.

The eyes of all creatures l\pointup{o}ok to you\Med\\

The Lord protects \pointup{a}ll who love him;\Med\\
but the wicked he will utterly d\pointup{e}stroy.

Let me speak the praise of the L\pointup{o}rd,\Flex\\
let all mankind bless his h\pointup{o}ly name\Med\\

as it was in the beginn\pointup{\i}ng, is now,\Med\\
and will be for ever. \pointupl{A}men.
