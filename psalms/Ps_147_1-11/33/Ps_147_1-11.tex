\FirstLetter{P}raise the Lord for he is g\pointup{o}od;\Flex\\
sing to our God for he \pointup{\i}s loving:\Med\\
to him our praise \pointup{\i}s due.

The Lord builds up J\pointup{e}rusalem\Med\\
and brings back Isra\pointup{e}l’s exiles,\\
he heals the brok\pointup{e}n-hearted,\Med\\
he binds up all th\pointup{e}ir wounds.\\
He fixes the number of th\pointup{e} stars;\Med\\
he calls each one by \pointup{\i}ts name.

Our Lord is great and \pointup{a}lmighty;\Med\\
his wisdom can never b\pointup{e} measured.\\
The Lord raises th\pointup{e} lowly;\Med\\
he humbles the wicked to th\pointup{e} dust.\\
O sing to the Lord giv\pointup{\i}ng thanks;\Med\\
sing psalms to our God with th\pointup{e} harp.

He covers the heavens w\pointup{\i}th clouds;\Med\\
he prepares the rain for th\pointup{e} earth,\\
making mountains sprout w\pointup{\i}th grass\Med\\
and with plants to serve m\pointup{a}n’s needs.\\
He provides the beasts with th\pointup{e}ir food\Med\\
and young ravens that call \pointup{u}pon him.

His delight is not \pointup{\i}n horses\Med\\
nor his pleasure in warri\pointup{o}rs’ strength.\\
The Lord delights in those who r\pointup{e}vere him,\Med\\
in those who wait for h\pointup{\i}s love.

Glory to the Father and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginning, \pointup{\i}s now,\Med\\
and will be for ever. \pointupl{A}men.
