\FirstLetter{P}raise the Lord for he is g\pointup{o}od;\Flex\\
sing to our God for h\pointup{e} is loving:\Med\\
to him our praise \pointup{\i}s due.

The Lord builds \pointup{u}p Jerusalem\Med\\
and brings back Isra\pointup{e}l’s exiles,\\
he heals the br\pointup{o}ken-hearted,\Med\\
he binds up all th\pointup{e}ir wounds.\\
He fixes the number \pointup{o}f the stars;\Med\\
he calls each one by \pointup{\i}ts name.

Our Lord is great \pointup{a}nd almighty;\Med\\
his wisdom can never b\pointup{e} measured.\\
The Lord rais\pointup{e}s the lowly;\Med\\
he humbles the wicked to th\pointup{e} dust.\\
O sing to the Lord g\pointup{\i}ving thanks;\Med\\
sing psalms to our God with th\pointup{e} harp.

He covers the heav\pointup{e}ns with clouds;\Med\\
he prepares the rain for th\pointup{e} earth,\\
making mountains spr\pointup{o}ut with grass\Med\\
and with plants to serve m\pointup{a}n’s needs.\\
He provides the beasts w\pointup{\i}th their food\Med\\
and young ravens that call \pointup{u}pon him.

His delight is n\pointup{o}t in horses\Med\\
nor his pleasure in warri\pointup{o}rs’ strength.\\
The Lord delights in those wh\pointup{o} revere him,\Med\\
in those who wait for h\pointup{\i}s love.

Glory to the Father and t\pointup{o} the Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginn\pointup{\i}ng, is now,\Med\\
and will be for ever. \pointupl{A}men.
