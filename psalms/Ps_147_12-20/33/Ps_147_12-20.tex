    \FirstLetter{O} praise the Lord, J\pointup{e}rusalem!\Med\\
    Zion, praise y\pointup{o}ur God!
    
    He has strengthened the bars of y\pointup{o}ur gates,\Med\\
    he has blessed the children w\pointup{\i}thin you.\\
    He established peace on y\pointup{o}ur borders,\Med\\
    he feeds you with fin\pointup{e}st wheat.
    
    He sends out his word to th\pointup{e} earth\Med\\
    and swiftly runs his c\pointup{o}mmand.\\
    He showers down snow white \pointup{a}s wool,\Med\\
    he scatters hoar-frost l\pointup{\i}ke ashes.
    
    He hurls down hailstones l\pointup{\i}ke crumbs.\Med\\
    The waters are frozen at h\pointup{\i}s touch;\\
    he sends forth his word and \pointup{\i}t melts them:\Med\\
    at the breath of his mouth the wat\pointup{e}rs flow.
    
    He makes his word known t\pointup{o} Jacob,\Med\\
    to Israel his laws and d\pointup{e}crees.\\
    He has not dealt thus with oth\pointup{e}r nations;\Med\\
    he has not taught them his d\pointup{e}crees.
    
    Glory to the Father and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
    and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
    as it was in the beginning, \pointup{\i}s now,\Med\\
    and will be forever. \pointupl{A}men.
