    \FirstLetter{O} praise the Lord, J\pointup{e}rusalem!\Med\\
    Zion, pr\pointup{a}ise your God!
    
    He has strengthened the bars of y\pointup{o}ur gates,\Med\\
    he has blessed the childr\pointup{e}n within you.\\
    He established peace on y\pointup{o}ur borders,\Med\\
    he feeds you with f\pointup{\i}nest wheat.
    
    He sends out his word to th\pointup{e} earth\Med\\
    and swiftly runs h\pointup{\i}s command.\\
    He showers down snow white \pointup{a}s wool,\Med\\
    he scatters hoar-fr\pointup{o}st like ashes.
    
    He hurls down hailstones l\pointup{\i}ke crumbs.\Med\\
    The waters are frozen \pointup{a}t his touch;\\
    he sends forth his word and \pointup{\i}t melts them:\Med\\
    at the breath of his mouth the w\pointup{a}ters flow.
    
    He makes his word known t\pointup{o} Jacob,\Med\\
    to Israel his laws \pointup{a}nd decrees.\\
    He has not dealt thus with oth\pointup{e}r nations;\Med\\
    he has not taught them h\pointup{\i}s decrees.
    
    Glory to the Father and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
    and to the H\pointup{o}ly Spirit:\\
    as it was in the beginning, \pointup{\i}s now,\Med\\
    and will be forev\pointup{e}r. Amen.
