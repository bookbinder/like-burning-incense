    \FirstLetter{O} praise the L\pointup{o}rd, Jerusalem!\Med\\
    Zion, praise y\pointup{o}ur God!
    
    He has strengthened the bars \pointup{o}f your gates,\Med\\
    he has blessed the children w\pointup{\i}thin you.\\
    He established peace \pointup{o}n your borders,\Med\\
    he feeds you with fin\pointup{e}st wheat.
    
    He sends out his word t\pointup{o} the earth\Med\\
    and swiftly runs his c\pointup{o}mmand.\\
    He showers down snow wh\pointup{\i}te as wool,\Med\\
    he scatters hoar-frost l\pointup{\i}ke ashes.
    
    He hurls down hailst\pointup{o}nes like crumbs.\Med\\
    The waters are frozen at h\pointup{\i}s touch;\\
    he sends forth his word \pointup{a}nd it melts them:\Med\\
    at the breath of his mouth the wat\pointup{e}rs flow.
    
    He makes his word kn\pointup{o}wn to Jacob,\Med\\
    to Israel his laws and d\pointup{e}crees.\\
    He has not dealt thus with \pointup{o}ther nations;\Med\\
    he has not taught them his d\pointup{e}crees.
    
    Glory to the Father and t\pointup{o} the Son,\Med\\
    and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
    as it was in the beginn\pointup{\i}ng, is now,\Med\\
    and will be forever. \pointupl{A}men.
