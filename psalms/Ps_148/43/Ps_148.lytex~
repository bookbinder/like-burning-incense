Praise the Lord from the heavens,
    praise him in the heights.
Praise him, all his angels,
    praise him, all his host.

Praise him, sun and moon,
    praise him, shining stars.
Praise him, highest heavens
    and the waters above the heavens.

Let them praise the name of the Lord.
    He commanded: they were made.
He fixed them for ever,
    gave a law which shall not pass away.

Praise the Lord from the earth,
    sea creatures and all oceans,
fire and hail, snow and mist,
    stormy winds that obey his word;

all mountains and hills,
    all fruit trees and cedars,
beasts, wild and tame,
    reptiles and birds on the wing;

all earth’s kings and peoples,
    earth’s princes and rulers,
young men and maidens,
    old men together with children.

Let them praise the name of the Lord
    for he alone is exalted.
The splendour of his name
    reaches beyond heaven and earth.

He exalts the strength of his people.
    He is the praise of all his saints,
of the sons of Israel,
    of the people to whom he comes close.

Glory to the Father and to the Son,
    and to the Holy Spirit:
as it was in the beginning, is now,
    and will be for ever. Amen.
