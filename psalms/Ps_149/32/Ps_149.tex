    \FirstLetter{S}ing a new song to th\pointup{e} Lord,\Med\\
his praise in the assembly of the f\pointup{a}ithful.\\
Let Israel rejoice in \pointup{\i}ts maker,\Med\\
let Zionâ€™s sons exult in their k\pointup{\i}ng.\\
Let them praise his name w\pointup{\i}th dancing\Med\\
and make music with timbrel and h\pointup{a}rp.

For the Lord takes delight in h\pointup{\i}s people.\Med\\
He crowns the poor with salv\pointup{a}tion.\\
Let the faithful rejoice in th\pointup{e}ir glory,\Med\\
shout for joy and take their r\pointup{e}st.\\
Let the praise of God be on th\pointup{e}ir lips\Med\\
and a two-edged sword in their h\pointup{a}nd,

to deal out vengeance to th\pointup{e} nations\Med\\
and punishment on all the p\pointup{e}oples;\\
to bind their kings \pointup{\i}n chains\Med\\
and their nobles in fetters of \pointup{\i}ron;\\
to carry out the sentence pre-\pointup{o}rdained;\Med\\
this honor is for all his f\pointup{a}ithful.

Glory to the Father and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
and to the Holy Sp\pointup{\i}rit:\\
as it was in the beginning, \pointup{\i}s now,\Med\\
and will be forever. Am\pointup{e}n.
