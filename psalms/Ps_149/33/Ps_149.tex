    \FirstLetter{S}ing a new song to th\pointup{e} Lord,\Med\\
his praise in the assembly of th\pointup{e} faithful.\\
Let Israel rejoice in \pointup{\i}ts maker,\Med\\
let Zionâ€™s sons exult in th\pointup{e}ir king.\\
Let them praise his name w\pointup{\i}th dancing\Med\\
and make music with timbrel \pointup{a}nd harp.

For the Lord takes delight in h\pointup{\i}s people.\Med\\
He crowns the poor with s\pointup{a}lvation.\\
Let the faithful rejoice in th\pointup{e}ir glory,\Med\\
shout for joy and take th\pointup{e}ir rest.\\
Let the praise of God be on th\pointup{e}ir lips\Med\\
and a two-edged sword in th\pointup{e}ir hand,

to deal out vengeance to th\pointup{e} nations\Med\\
and punishment on all th\pointup{e} peoples;\\
to bind their kings \pointup{\i}n chains\Med\\
and their nobles in fetters \pointup{o}f iron;\\
to carry out the sentence pre-\pointup{o}rdained;\Med\\
this honor is for all h\pointup{\i}s faithful.

Glory to the Father and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginning, \pointup{\i}s now,\Med\\
and will be forever. \pointupl{A}men.
