    \FirstLetter{S}ing a new song to th\pointup{e} Lord,\Med\\
his praise in the assembly \pointup{o}f the faithful.\\
Let Israel rejoice in \pointup{\i}ts maker,\Med\\
let Zionâ€™s sons exult \pointup{i}n their king.\\
Let them praise his name w\pointup{\i}th dancing\Med\\
and make music with timbr\pointup{e}l and harp.

For the Lord takes delight in h\pointup{\i}s people.\Med\\
He crowns the poor w\pointup{i}th salvation.\\
Let the faithful rejoice in th\pointup{e}ir glory,\Med\\
shout for joy and t\pointup{a}ke their rest.\\
Let the praise of God be on th\pointup{e}ir lips\Med\\
and a two-edged sword \pointup{i}n their hand,

to deal out vengeance to th\pointup{e} nations\Med\\
and punishment on \pointup{a}ll the peoples;\\
to bind their kings \pointup{\i}n chains\Med\\
and their nobles in fett\pointup{e}rs of iron;\\
to carry out the sentence pre-\pointup{o}rdained;\Med\\
this honor is for \pointup{a}ll his faithful.

Glory to the Father and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
and to the H\pointup{o}ly Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginning, \pointup{\i}s now,\Med\\
and will be forev\pointup{e}r. Amen.
