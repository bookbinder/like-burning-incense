    \FirstLetter{S}ing a new song t\pointup{o} the Lord,\Med\\
his praise in the assembly of the f\pointup{a}ithful.\\
Let Israel rejoice \pointup{\i}n its maker,\Med\\
let Zionâ€™s sons exult in their k\pointup{\i}ng.\\
Let them praise his n\pointup{a}me with dancing\Med\\
and make music with timbrel and h\pointup{a}rp.

For the Lord takes delight \pointup{\i}n his people.\Med\\
He crowns the poor with salv\pointup{a}tion.\\
Let the faithful rejoice \pointup{\i}n their glory,\Med\\
shout for joy and take their r\pointup{e}st.\\
Let the praise of God be \pointup{o}n their lips\Med\\
and a two-edged sword in their h\pointup{a}nd,

to deal out vengeance t\pointup{o} the nations\Med\\
and punishment on all the p\pointup{e}oples;\\
to bind their k\pointup{\i}ngs in chains\Med\\
and their nobles in fetters of \pointup{\i}ron;\\
to carry out the sentence pr\pointup{e}-ordained;\Med\\
this honor is for all his f\pointup{a}ithful.

Glory to the Father and t\pointup{o} the Son,\Med\\
and to the Holy Sp\pointup{\i}rit:\\
as it was in the beginn\pointup{\i}ng, is now,\Med\\
and will be forever. Am\pointup{e}n.
