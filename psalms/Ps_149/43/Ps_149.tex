    \FirstLetter{S}ing a new song t\pointup{o} the Lord,\Med\\
his praise in the assembly of th\pointup{e} faithful.\\
Let Israel rejoice \pointup{\i}n its maker,\Med\\
let Zionâ€™s sons exult in th\pointup{e}ir king.\\
Let them praise his n\pointup{a}me with dancing\Med\\
and make music with timbrel \pointup{a}nd harp.

For the Lord takes delight \pointup{\i}n his people.\Med\\
He crowns the poor with s\pointup{a}lvation.\\
Let the faithful rejoice \pointup{\i}n their glory,\Med\\
shout for joy and take th\pointup{e}ir rest.\\
Let the praise of God be \pointup{o}n their lips\Med\\
and a two-edged sword in th\pointup{e}ir hand,

to deal out vengeance t\pointup{o} the nations\Med\\
and punishment on all th\pointup{e} peoples;\\
to bind their k\pointup{\i}ngs in chains\Med\\
and their nobles in fetters \pointup{o}f iron;\\
to carry out the sentence pr\pointup{e}-ordained;\Med\\
this honor is for all h\pointup{\i}s faithful.

Glory to the Father and t\pointup{o} the Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginn\pointup{\i}ng, is now,\Med\\
and will be forever. \pointupl{A}men.
