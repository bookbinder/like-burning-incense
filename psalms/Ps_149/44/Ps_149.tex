    \FirstLetter{S}ing a new song t\pointup{o} the Lord,\Med\\
his praise in the assembly \pointup{o}f the faithful.\\
Let Israel rejoice \pointup{\i}n its maker,\Med\\
let Zionâ€™s sons exult \pointup{\i}n their king.\\
Let them praise his n\pointup{a}me with dancing\Med\\
and make music with timbr\pointup{e}l and harp.

For the Lord takes delight \pointup{\i}n his people.\Med\\
He crowns the poor w\pointup{\i}th salvation.\\
Let the faithful rejoice \pointup{\i}n their glory,\Med\\
shout for joy and t\pointup{a}ke their rest.\\
Let the praise of God be \pointup{o}n their lips\Med\\
and a two-edged sword \pointup{\i}n their hand,

to deal out vengeance t\pointup{o} the nations\Med\\
and punishment on \pointup{a}ll the peoples;\\
to bind their k\pointup{\i}ngs in chains\Med\\
and their nobles in fett\pointup{e}rs of iron;\\
to carry out the sentence pr\pointup{e}-ordained;\Med\\
this honor is for \pointup{a}ll his faithful.

Glory to the Father and t\pointup{o} the Son,\Med\\
and to the H\pointup{o}ly Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginn\pointup{\i}ng, is now,\Med\\
and will be forev\pointup{e}r. Amen.
