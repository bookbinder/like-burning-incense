\FirstLetter{L}ord, who shall be admitted to y\pointup{o}ur tent\Med\\
and dwell on your holy m\pointup{o}untain?

He who walks with\pointup{o}ut fault:\Med\\
he who acts with j\pointup{u}stice
and speaks the truth from h\pointup{\i}s heart;\Med\\
he who does not slander with his t\pointup{o}ngue;

he who does no wrong to h\pointup{\i}s brother,\Med\\
who casts no slur on his n\pointup{e}ighbor,
who holds the godless in d\pointup{\i}sdain,\Med\\
but honors those who fear the L\pointup{o}rd;

he who keeps his pledge, come wh\pointup{a}t may;\Med\\
who takes no interest on a l\pointup{o}an
and accepts no bribes against th\pointup{e} innocent.\Med\\
Such a man will stand firm for \pointup{e}ver.

Glory to the Father, and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
and to the Holy Sp\pointup{\i}rit:
as it was in the beginning, \pointup{\i}s now,\Med\\
and will be for ever. Am\pointup{e}n.
