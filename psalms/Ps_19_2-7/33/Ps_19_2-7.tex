\FirstLetter{T}he heavens proclaim the glory \pointup{o}f God,\Med\\
and the firmament shows forth the work of h\pointup{\i}s hands.\\
Day unto day takes up th\pointup{e} story\Med\\
and night unto night makes known th\pointup{e} message.

No speech, no word, no voice is h\pointup{e}ard\Flex\\
yet their span extends through all th\pointup{e} earth,\Med\\
their words to the utmost bounds of th\pointup{e} world.

There he has placed a tent for the s\pointup{u}n;\Flex\\
it comes forth like a bridegroom coming from h\pointup{i}s tent,\Med\\
rejoices like a champion to run \pointup{\i}ts course.

At the end of the sky is the rising of the s\pointup{u}n;\Flex\\
to the furthest end of the sky is \pointup{i}ts course.\Med\\
There is nothing concealed from its burn\pointup{\i}ng heat.

Glory to the Father and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginning, \pointup{i}s now,\Med\\
and will be forever. \pointupl{A}men.
