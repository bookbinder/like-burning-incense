\FirstLetter{T}he heavens proclaim the glor\pointup{y} of God,\Med\\
and the firmament shows forth the work of h\pointup{\i}s hands.\\
Day unto day takes \pointup{u}p the story\Med\\
and night unto night makes known th\pointup{e} message.

No speech, no word, no voice is h\pointup{e}ard\Flex\\
yet their span extends through \pointup{a}ll the earth,\Med\\
their words to the utmost bounds of th\pointup{e} world.

There he has placed a tent for the s\pointup{u}n;\Flex\\
it comes forth like a bridegroom coming fr\pointup{o}m his tent,\Med\\
rejoices like a champion to run \pointup{\i}ts course.

At the end of the sky is the rising of the s\pointup{u}n;\Flex\\
to the furthest end of the sky \pointup{\i}s its course.\Med\\
There is nothing concealed from its burn\pointup{\i}ng heat.

Glory to the Father and t\pointup{o} the Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginn\pointup{\i}ng, is now,\Med\\
and will be forever. \pointupl{A}men.
