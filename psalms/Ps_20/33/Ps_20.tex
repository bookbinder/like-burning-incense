\FirstLetter{M}ay the Lord answer in time \pointup{o}f trial;\Med\\
may the name of Jacob’s God pr\pointup{o}tect you.

May he send you help from h\pointup{\i}s shrine\Med\\

and rejoice in the name of \pointup{o}ur God.\Med\\
May the Lord grant all y\pointup{o}ur prayers.

I am sure now that th\pointup{e} Lord\Med\\

but we in the name of th\pointup{e} Lord.\\
They will collapse \pointup{a}nd fall,\Med\\
but we shall hold and st\pointup{a}nd firm.

Give victory to the king, \pointup{O} Lord,\Med\\
give answer on the day w\pointup{e} call.

Glory to the Father, and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginning, \pointup{\i}s now,\Med\\
and will be for ever. \pointupl{A}men.
