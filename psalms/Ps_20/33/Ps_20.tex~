Psalm 20
A prayer for the king’s victory

Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord will be saved (Acts 2:21).

May the Lord answer in time of trial; *
may the name of Jacob’s God protect you.

May he send you help from his shrine *
and give you support from Zion.
May he remember all your offerings *
and receive your sacrifice with favor.

May he give you your heart’s desire *
and fulfill every one of your plans.
May we ring out our joy at your victory †
and rejoice in the name of our God. *
May the Lord grant all your prayers.

I am sure now that the Lord *
will give victory to his anointed,
will reply from his holy heaven *
with the mighty victory of his hand.

Some trust in chariots or horses, *
but we in the name of the Lord.
They will collapse and fall, *
but we shall hold and stand firm.

Give victory to the king, O Lord, *
give answer on the day we call.

Glory to the Father, and to the Son, *
and to the Holy Spirit:
as it was in the beginning, is now, *
and will be for ever. Amen.
