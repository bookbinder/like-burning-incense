\FirstLetter{M}ay the Lord answer in t\pointup{\i}me of trial;\Med\\
may the name of Jacob’s God pr\pointup{o}tect you.

May he send you help fr\pointup{o}m his shrine\Med\\
and give you support fr\pointup{o}m Zion.\\
May he remember \pointup{a}ll your offerings\Med\\
and receive your sacrifice w\pointup{\i}th favor.

May he give you your h\pointup{e}art’s desire\Med\\
and fulfill every one of y\pointup{o}ur plans.\\
May we ring out our joy at your vict\pointup{o}ry\Flex\\
and rejoice in the name \pointup{o}f our God.\Med\\
May the Lord grant all y\pointup{o}ur prayers.

I am sure now th\pointup{a}t the Lord\Med\\
will give victory to his \pointup{a}nointed,\\
will reply from his h\pointup{o}ly heaven\Med\\
with the mighty victory of h\pointup{\i}s hand.

Some trust in chari\pointup{o}ts or horses,\Med\\
but we in the name of th\pointup{e} Lord.\\
They will coll\pointup{a}pse and fall,\Med\\
but we shall hold and st\pointup{a}nd firm.

Give victory to the k\pointup{\i}ng, O Lord,\Med\\
give answer on the day w\pointup{e} call.

Glory to the Father, and t\pointup{o} the Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginn\pointup{\i}ng, is now,\Med\\
and will be for ever. \pointupl{A}men.
