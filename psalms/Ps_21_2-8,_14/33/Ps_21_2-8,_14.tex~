Psalm 21:2-8, 14
Thanksgiving for the king’s victory

He accepted life that he might rise and live for ever (Saint Hilary).

O Lord, your strength gives joy to the king; *
how your saving help makes him glad!
You have granted him his heart’s desire; *
you have not refused the prayer of his lips.

You came to meet him with the blessings of success, *
you have set on his head a crown of pure gold.
He asked you for life and this you have given, *
days that will last from age to age.

Your saving help has given him glory. *
You have laid upon him majesty and splendor,
you have granted your blessings to him for ever. *
You have made him rejoice with the joy of your presence.

The king has put his trust in the Lord: *
through the mercy of the Most High he shall stand firm.
O Lord, arise in your strength; *
we shall sing and praise your power.

Glory to the Father, and to the Son *
and to the Holy Spirit:
as it was in the beginning, is now, *
and will be for ever. Amen.
