The Lordâ€™s is the earth and its fullness,
    the world and all its peoples.
It is he who set it on the seas;
    on the waters he made it firm.

Who shall climb the mountain of the Lord?
    Who shall stand in his holy place?
The man with clean hands and pure heart,
    who desires not worthless things,
    who has not sworn so as to deceive his neighbour.

He shall receive blessings from the Lord
    and reward from the God who saves him.
Such are the men who seek him,
    seek the face of the God of Jacob.

O gates, lift high your heads;
    grow higher, ancient doors.
    Let him enter, the king of glory!

Who is the king of glory?
    The Lord, the mighty, the valiant,
    the Lord, the valiant in war.

O gates, lift high your heads;
    grow higher, ancient doors.
    Let him enter, the king of glory!

Who is he, the king of glory?
    He, the Lord of armies,
    he is the king of glory.

Glory to the Father and to the Son,
    and to the Holy Spirit:
as it was in the beginning, is now,
    and will be for ever. Amen.
