    \FirstLetter{T}he Lordâ€™s is the earth \pointup{a}nd its fullness,\Med\\
    the world and all its p\pointup{e}oples.\\
It is he who set it \pointup{o}n the seas;\Med\\
    on the waters he made it f\pointup{\i}rm.

Who shall climb the mountain \pointup{o}f the Lord?\Med\\
    Who shall stand in his holy pl\pointup{a}ce?\\
The man with clean hands and pure h\pointup{e}art,\Flex\\
    who desires not w\pointup{o}rthless things,\Med\\
    who has not sworn so as to deceive his n\pointup{e}ighbour.

He shall receive blessings fr\pointup{o}m the Lord\Med\\
    and reward from the God who saves h\pointup{\i}m.\\
Such are the m\pointup{e}n who seek him,\Med\\
    seek the face of the God of J\pointup{a}cob.

O gates, lift high your h\pointup{e}ads;\Flex\\
    grow higher, \pointup{a}ncient doors.\Med\\
    Let him enter, the king of gl\pointup{o}ry!

Who is the king of gl\pointup{o}ry?\Flex\\
    The Lord, the might\pointup{y}, the valiant,\Med\\
    the Lord, the valiant in w\pointup{a}r.

O gates, lift high your h\pointup{e}ads;\Flex\\
    grow higher, \pointup{a}ncient doors.\Med\\
    Let him enter, the king of gl\pointup{o}ry!

Who is he, the king of gl\pointup{o}ry?\Flex\\
    He, the L\pointup{o}rd of armies,\Med\\
    he is the king of gl\pointup{o}ry.

Glory to the Father and t\pointup{o} the Son,\Med\\
    and to the Holy Sp\pointup{\i}rit:\\
as it was in the beginn\pointup{\i}ng, is now,\Med\\
    and will be for ever. Am\pointup{e}n.
