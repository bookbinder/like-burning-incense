\FirstLetter{T}he Lord is my light and m\pointup{y} help;\Med\\
whom shall \pointup{I} fear?\\
The Lord is the stronghold of m\pointup{y} life;\Med\\
before whom shall \pointup{I} shrink?

When evil-doers dr\pointup{a}w near\Med\\
to devour m\pointup{y} flesh,\\
it is they, my enemies \pointup{a}nd foes,\Med\\
who stumble \pointup{a}nd fall.

Though an army encamp \pointup{a}gainst me\Med\\
my heart would n\pointup{o}t fear.\\
Though war break out \pointup{a}gainst me\Med\\
even then would \pointup{I} trust.

There is one thing I ask of th\pointup{e} Lord,\Med\\
for this \pointup{I} long,\\
to live in the house of th\pointup{e} Lord,\Med\\
all the days of m\pointup{y} life,\\
to savor the sweetness of th\pointup{e} Lord,\Med\\
to behold h\pointup{\i}s temple.

For there he keeps me safe in h\pointup{\i}s tent\Med\\
in the day \pointup{o}f evil.\\
He hides me in the shelter of h\pointup{\i}s tent,\Med\\
on a rock he sets m\pointup{e} safe.

And now my head shall b\pointup{e} raised\Med\\
above my foes who s\pointup{u}rround me\\
and I shall offer within his t\pointup{e}nt\Flex\\
a sacrifice \pointup{o}f joy.\Med\\
I will sing and make music for th\pointup{e} Lord.

Glory to the Father and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginning, \pointup{\i}s now,\Med\\
and will be forever. \pointupl{A}men.
