\FirstLetter{O} Lord, hear my voice when \pointup{I} call;\Med\\
have mercy \pointup{a}nd answer.\\
Of you my heart h\pointup{a}s spoken:\Med\\
“Seek h\pointup{\i}s face.”

It is your face, O Lord, that \pointup{I} seek;\Med\\
hide not y\pointup{o}ur face.\\
Dismiss not your servant \pointup{\i}n anger;\Med\\
you have been m\pointup{y} help.

Do not abandon or f\pointup{o}rsake me,\Med\\
O God m\pointup{y} help!\\
Though father and mother f\pointup{o}rsake me,\Med\\
the Lord will r\pointup{e}ceive me.

Instruct me, Lord, in y\pointup{o}ur way;\Med\\
on an even p\pointup{a}th lead me.\\
When they lie in ambush pr\pointup{o}tect me\Med\\
from my enem\pointup{y}’s greed.\\
False witnesses rise \pointup{a}gainst me,\Med\\
breathing \pointup{o}ut fury.

I am sure I shall see the L\pointup{o}rd’s goodness\Med\\
in the land of th\pointup{e} living.\\
Hope in him, hold firm and t\pointup{a}ke heart.\Med\\
Hope in th\pointup{e} Lord!

Glory to the Father and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginning, \pointup{\i}s now,\Med\\
and will be forever. \pointupl{A}men.
