\FirstLetter{O} Lord, hear my voice wh\pointup{e}n I call;\Med\\
have mercy \pointup{a}nd answer.\\
Of you my h\pointup{e}art has spoken:\Med\\
“Seek h\pointup{\i}s face.”

It is your face, O Lord, th\pointup{a}t I seek;\Med\\
hide not y\pointup{o}ur face.\\
Dismiss not your serv\pointup{a}nt in anger;\Med\\
you have been m\pointup{y} help.

Do not abandon \pointup{o}r forsake me,\Med\\
O God m\pointup{y} help!\\
Though father and moth\pointup{e}r forsake me,\Med\\
the Lord will r\pointup{e}ceive me.

Instruct me, Lord, \pointup{\i}n your way;\Med\\
on an even p\pointup{a}th lead me.\\
When they lie in amb\pointup{u}sh protect me\Med\\
from my enem\pointup{y}’s greed.\\
False witnesses r\pointup{\i}se against me,\Med\\
breathing \pointup{o}ut fury.

I am sure I shall see th\pointup{e} Lord’s goodness\Med\\
in the land of th\pointup{e} living.\\
Hope in him, hold firm \pointup{a}nd take heart.\Med\\
Hope in th\pointup{e} Lord!

Glory to the Father and t\pointup{o} the Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginn\pointup{\i}ng, is now,\Med\\
and will be forever. \pointupl{A}men.
