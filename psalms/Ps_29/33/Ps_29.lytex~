O give the Lord, you sons of God,
    give the Lord glory and power;
give the Lord the glory of his name.
    Adore the Lord in his holy court.

The Lord’s voice resounding on the waters,
    the Lord on the immensity of waters;
the voice of the Lord, full of power,
    the voice of the Lord, full of splendour.

The Lord’s voice shattering the cedars,
    the Lord shatters the cedars of Lebanon;
he makes Lebanon leap like a calf
    and Sirion like a young wild ox.

The Lord’s voice flashes flames of fire.
    The Lord’s voice shaking the wilderness,
    the Lord shakes the wilderness of Kadesh;
the Lord’s voice rending the oak tree
    and stripping the forest bare.

The God of glory thunders.
    In his temple they all cry: ‘Glory!’
The Lord sat enthroned over the flood;
    the Lord sits as king for ever.

The Lord will give strength to his people,
    the Lord will bless his people with peace.

Glory to the Father and to the Son,
    and to the Holy Spirit:
as it was in the beginning, is now,
    and will be for ever. Amen.
