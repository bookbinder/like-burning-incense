\FirstLetter{I} will praise you, Lord, you h\pointup{a}ve rescued me\Med\\
and have not let my enemies rejoice over m\pointup{e}.

O Lord, I cried to you f\pointup{o}r help\Med\\
and you, my God, have h\pointup{e}aled me.\\
O Lord, you have raised my soul from th\pointup{e} dead,\Med\\
restored me to life from those who sink into the gr\pointup{a}ve.

Sing psalms to the Lord, you wh\pointup{o} love him,\Med\\
give thanks to his holy n\pointup{a}me.\\
His anger lasts a moment; his favor all thr\pointup{o}ugh life.\Med\\
At night there are tears, but joy comes with d\pointup{a}wn.

I said to myself in my g\pointup{o}od fortune:\Med\\
“Nothing will ever dist\pointup{u}rb me.”\\
Your favor had set me on a mount\pointup{a}in fastness,\Med\\
then you hid your face and I was put to conf\pointup{u}sion.

To you, Lord, \pointup{I} cried,\Med\\
to my God I made app\pointup{e}al:\\
“What profit would my death be, my going to th\pointup{e} grave?\Med\\
Can dust give you praise or proclaim your tr\pointup{u}th?

The Lord listened and h\pointup{a}d pity.\Med\\
The Lord came to my h\pointup{e}lp.\\
For me you have changed my mourning int\pointup{o} dancing,\Med\\
you removed my sackcloth and clothed me with j\pointup{o}y.\\
So my soul sings psalms to you \pointup{u}nceasingly.\Med\\
O Lord my God, I will thank you for \pointup{e}ver.

Glory to the Father and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
and to the Holy Sp\pointup{\i}rit:\\
as it was in the beginning, \pointup{\i}s now,\Med\\
and will be forever. Am\pointup{e}n.
