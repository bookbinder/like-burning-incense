Psalm 31:2-6
Trustful prayer in time of adversity
“Father, into your hands I commend my spirit” (Lk 23:46).

In you, O Lord, I take refuge.
    Let me never be put to shame.
In your justice, set me free,
    hear me and speedily rescue me.

Be a rock of refuge for me,
    a mighty stronghold to save me,
for you are my rock, my stronghold.
    For your name’s sake, lead me and guide me.

Release me from the snares they have hidden
    for you are my refuge, Lord.
Into your hands I commend my spirit.
    It is you who will redeem me, Lord.

Glory to the Father and to the Son,
    and to the Holy Spirit:
as it was in the beginning, is now,
    and will be for ever. Amen.
