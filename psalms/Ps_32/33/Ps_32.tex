\FirstLetter{H}appy the man whose offense is f\pointup{o}rgiven,\Med\\
whose sin is r\pointup{e}mitted.\\
O happy the man to whom the L\pointup{o}rd\Flex\\
imputes n\pointup{o} guilt,\Med\\
in whose spirit is n\pointup{o} guile.

I kept it secret and my frame was wast\pointup{e}d.\Flex\\
I groaned all d\pointup{a}y long,\Med\\
for night and day your hand was heavy \pointup{u}pon me.\\
Indeed my strength was dr\pointup{\i}ed up\Med\\
as by the summ\pointup{e}r’s heat.

But now I have acknowledged m\pointup{y} sins;\Med\\
my guilt I did n\pointup{o}t hide.\\
I said: “I will c\pointup{o}nfess\Med\\
my offense to th\pointup{e} Lord.”\\
And you, Lord, have f\pointup{o}rgiven\Med\\
the guilt of m\pointup{y} sin.

So let every good man pray t\pointup{o} you\Med\\
in the time \pointup{o}f need.\\
The floods of water may r\pointup{e}ach high\Med\\
but him they shall n\pointup{o}t reach.\\
You are my hiding place, O L\pointup{o}rd;\Flex\\
you save me from d\pointup{\i}stress.\Med\\
You surround me with cries of d\pointup{e}liverance.

I will instruct you \pointup{a}nd teach you\Med\\
the way you sh\pointup{o}uld go;\\
I will give y\pointup{o}u counsel\Med\\
with my eye \pointup{u}pon you.

Be not like horse and mule, unintell\pointup{\i}gent,\Flex\\
needing bridle \pointup{a}nd bit;\Med\\
else they will not approach you.\Med\\
Many sorrows has the wick\pointup{e}d\\
but he who trusts in th\pointup{e} Lord,\Med\\
loving mercy s\pointup{u}rrounds him.

Rejoice, rejoice in th\pointup{e} Lord,\Med\\
exult, y\pointup{o}u just!\\
O come, ring out y\pointup{o}ur joy,\Med\\
all you upright \pointup{o}f heart.

Glory to the Father and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginning, \pointup{\i}s now,\Med\\
and will be forever. \pointupl{A}men.
