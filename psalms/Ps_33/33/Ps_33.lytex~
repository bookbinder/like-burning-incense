It is good to give thanks to the Lord,
    to make music to your name, O Most High,
to proclaim your love in the morning
    and your truth in the watches of the night,
on the ten-stringed lyre and the lute,
    with the murmuring sound of the harp.

Your deeds, O Lord, have made me glad;
    for the work of your hands I shout with joy.
O Lord, how great are your works!
    How deep are your designs!
The foolish man cannot know this
    and the fool cannot understand.

Though the wicked spring up like grass
    and all who do evil thrive,
they are doomed to be eternally destroyed.
    But you, Lord, are eternally on high.
See how your enemies perish;
    all doers of evil are scattered.

To me you give the wild oxâ€™s strength;
    you anoint me with the purest oil.
My eyes looked in triumph on my foes;
    my ears heard gladly of their fall.
The just will flourish like the palm-tree
    and grow like a Lebanon cedar.

Planted in the house of the Lord
    they will flourish in the courts of our God,
still bearing fruit when they are old,
    still full of sap, still green,
to proclaim that the Lord is just.
    In him, my rock, there is no wrong.

Glory to the Father and to the Son,
    and to the Holy Spirit:
as it was in the beginning, is now,
    and will be for ever. Amen.
