When I call, answer me, O God of justice;
    from anguish you released me, have mercy and hear me!

O men, how long will your hearts be closed,
    will you love what is futile and seek what is false?

It is the Lord who grants favours to those whom he loves;
    the Lord hears me whenever I call him.

Fear him; do not sin: ponder on your bed and be still
    Make justice your sacrifice, and trust in the Lord.

‘What can bring us happiness?’ many say.
    Let the light of your face shine on us, O Lord.

You have put into my heart a greater joy
    than they have from abundance of corn and new wine.

I will lie down in peace and sleep comes at once
    for you alone, Lord, make me dwell in safety.
