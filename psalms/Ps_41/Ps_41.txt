Psalm 41
Prayer of a sick person
One of you will betray me, yes, one who eats with me (Mark 14:18).

Happy the man who considers the poor and the weak.
The Lord will save him in the day of evil,
will guard him, give him life, make him happy in the land
and will not give him up to the will of his foes.
The Lord will help him on his bed of pain,
he will bring him back from sickness to health.

As for me, I said: “Lord, have mercy on me,
heal my soul for I have sinned against you.”
My foes are speaking evil against me.
“how long before he dies and his name be forgotten?”

They come to visit me and speak empty words,
their hearts full of malice, they spread it abroad.

My enemies whisper together against me.
They all weigh up the evil which is on me.
“Some deadly thing has fastened upon him,
he will not rise again from where he lies.”
Thus even my friend, in whom I trusted,
who ate my bread, has turned against me.

But you, O Lord, have mercy on me.
Let me rise once more and I will repay them.
By this I shall know that you are my friend,
if my foes do not shout in triumph over me.
If you uphold me I shall be unharmed
and set in your presence for ever more.

Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel
from age to age. Amen. Amen.

Glory to the Father and to the Son,
and to the Holy Spirit:
as it was in the beginning, is now,
and will be forever. Amen.
