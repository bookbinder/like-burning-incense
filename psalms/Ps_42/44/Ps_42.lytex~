\FirstLetter{L}ike the d\pointup{e}er that yearns\Med\\
for r\pointup{u}nning streams,\\
so my s\pointup{o}ul is yearning\Med\\
for y\pointup{o}u, my God.

My soul is thirst\pointup{\i}ng for God,\Med\\
the God \pointup{o}f my life;\\
when can I ent\pointup{e}r and see\Med\\
the f\pointup{a}ce of God?

My tears have bec\pointup{o}me my bread,\Med\\
by n\pointup{\i}ght, by day,\\
as I hear it said all th\pointup{e} day long:\Med\\
“Where \pointup{\i}s your God?”

These things will \pointup{I} remember\Med\\
as I pour \pointup{o}ut my soul:\\
how I would lead the rej\pointup{o}icing crowd\Med\\
into the h\pointup{o}use of God,\\
amid cries of gladness \pointup{a}nd thanksgiving,\Med\\
the throng w\pointup{\i}ld with joy.

Why are you cast d\pointup{o}wn, my soul,\Med\\
why gr\pointup{o}an within me?\\
Hope in God; I will pr\pointup{a}ise him still,\Med\\
my savior \pointup{a}nd my God.

My soul is cast d\pointup{o}wn within me\Med\\
as I th\pointup{\i}nk of you,\\
from the country of Jordan \pointup{a}nd Mount Hermon,\Med\\
from the H\pointup{\i}ll of Mizar.

Deep is call\pointup{\i}ng on deep,\Med\\
in the roar \pointup{o}f the waters;\\
your torrents and \pointup{a}ll your waves\Med\\
swept \pointup{o}ver me.

By day the L\pointup{o}rd will send\Med\\
his l\pointup{o}ving kindness;\\
by night I will s\pointup{\i}ng to him,\Med\\
praise the God \pointup{o}f my life.

I will say to G\pointup{o}d, my rock:\Med\\
“Why have y\pointup{o}u forgotten me?\\
Why do \pointup{I} go mourning\Med\\
oppressed b\pointup{y} the foe?”

With cries that pierce me t\pointup{o} my heart,\Med\\
my enem\pointup{\i}es revile me,\\
saying to me \pointup{a}ll day long:\Med\\
“Where \pointup{\i}s your God?”

Why are you cast d\pointup{o}wn, my soul,\Med\\
why gr\pointup{o}an within me?\\
Hope in God; I will pr\pointup{a}ise him still,\Med\\
my savior \pointup{a}nd my God.

Glory to the Father and t\pointup{o} the Son,\Med\\
and to the H\pointup{o}ly Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginn\pointup{\i}ng, is now,\Med\\
and will be forev\pointup{e}r. Amen.
