against a godl\pointup{e}ss nation.\\
From deceitful and cunn\pointup{\i}ng men\Med\\
rescue me, \pointup{O} God.

Since you, O God, are m\pointup{y} stronghold,\Med\\
why have you r\pointup{e}jected me?\\
Why do I g\pointup{o} mourning\Med\\
oppressed by th\pointup{e} foe?

O send forth your light and y\pointup{o}ur truth;\Med\\
let these be m\pointup{y} guide.\\
Let them bring me to your hol\pointup{y} mountain,\Med\\
to the place where y\pointup{o}u dwell.

And I will come to the altar \pointup{o}f God,\Med\\
the God of m\pointup{y} joy.\\
My redeemer, I will thank you on th\pointup{e} harp,\Med\\
O God, m\pointup{y} God.

Why are you cast down m\pointup{y} soul,\Med\\
why groan w\pointup{\i}thin me?\\
Hope in God; I will praise h\pointup{\i}m still,\Med\\
my savior and m\pointup{y} God.

Glory to the Father and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginning, \pointup{\i}s now,\Med\\
and will be forever. \pointupl{A}men.
