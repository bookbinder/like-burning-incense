    \FirstLetter{D}efend me, O God, and pl\pointup{e}ad my cause\Med\\
against a godl\pointup{e}ss nation.\\
From deceitful and c\pointup{u}nning men\Med\\
rescue me, \pointup{O} God.

Since you, O God, \pointup{a}re my stronghold,\Med\\
why have you r\pointup{e}jected me?\\
Why do \pointup{I} go mourning\Med\\
oppressed by th\pointup{e} foe?

O send forth your light \pointup{a}nd your truth;\Med\\
let these be m\pointup{y} guide.\\
Let them bring me to your h\pointup{o}ly mountain,\Med\\
to the place where y\pointup{o}u dwell.

And I will come to the alt\pointup{a}r of God,\Med\\
the God of m\pointup{y} joy.\\
My redeemer, I will thank you \pointup{o}n the harp,\Med\\
O God, m\pointup{y} God.

Why are you cast d\pointup{o}wn my soul,\Med\\
why groan w\pointup{\i}thin me?\\
Hope in God; I will pr\pointup{a}ise him still,\Med\\
my savior and m\pointup{y} God.

Glory to the Father and t\pointup{o} the Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginn\pointup{\i}ng, is now,\Med\\
and will be forever. \pointupl{A}men.
