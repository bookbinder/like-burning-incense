\FirstLetter{L}isten, O daughter, give ear to m\pointup{y} words:\Med\\
forget your own people and your fath\pointup{e}râ€™s house.\\
So will the king desire y\pointup{o}ur beauty:\Med\\
He is your lord, pay homage t\pointup{o} him.

And the people of Tyre shall come w\pointup{\i}th gifts,\Med\\
the richest of the people shall seek y\pointup{o}ur favor.\\
The daughter of the king is clothed w\pointup{\i}th splendor,\Med\\
her robes embroidered with pearls set \pointup{\i}n gold.

She is led to the king with her maiden compan\pointup{\i}ons.\Flex\\
They are escorted amid gladness \pointup{a}nd joy;\Med\\
they pass within the palace of th\pointup{e} king.

Sons shall be yours in place of y\pointup{o}ur fathers:\Med\\
you will make them rulers over all th\pointup{e} earth.\\
May this song make your name for ever r\pointup{e}membered.\Med\\
May the peoples praise you from age t\pointup{o} age.

Glory to the Father and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginning, \pointup{\i}s now,\Med\\
and will be forever. \pointupl{A}men.
