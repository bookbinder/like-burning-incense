\FirstLetter{L}isten, O daughter, give ear t\pointup{o} my words:\Med\\
forget your own people and your f\pointup{a}therâ€™s house.\\
So will the king des\pointup{\i}re your beauty:\Med\\
He is your lord, pay hom\pointup{a}ge to him.

And the people of Tyre shall c\pointup{o}me with gifts,\Med\\
the richest of the people shall s\pointup{e}ek your favor.\\
The daughter of the king is cl\pointup{o}thed with splendor,\Med\\
her robes embroidered with pearls s\pointup{e}t in gold.

She is led to the king with her maiden comp\pointup{a}nions.\Flex\\
They are escorted amid gladn\pointup{e}ss and joy;\Med\\
they pass within the palace \pointup{o}f the king.

Sons shall be yours in place \pointup{o}f your fathers:\Med\\
you will make them rulers over \pointup{a}ll the earth.\\
May this song make your name for ev\pointup{e}r remembered.\Med\\
May the peoples praise you from \pointup{a}ge to age.

Glory to the Father and t\pointup{o} the Son,\Med\\
and to the H\pointup{o}ly Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginn\pointup{\i}ng, is now,\Med\\
and will be forev\pointup{e}r. Amen.
