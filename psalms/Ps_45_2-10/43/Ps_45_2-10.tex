\FirstLetter{M}y heart overflows with noble w\pointup{o}rds.\Flex\\
To the king I must speak the song \pointup{I} have made,\Med\\
my tongue as nimble as the pen of \pointup{a} scribe.

You are the fairest of the children of m\pointup{e}n\Flex\\
and graciousness is poured up\pointup{o}n your lips:\Med\\
because God has blessed you for ev\pointup{e}rmore.

O mighty one, gird your sword upon your th\pointup{\i}gh;\Flex\\
in splendor and state, ride \pointup{o}n in triumph\Med\\
for the cause of truth and goodness \pointup{a}nd right.

Take aim with your bow in your dread right h\pointup{a}nd.\Flex\\
Your arrows are sharp, peoples f\pointup{a}ll beneath you.\Med\\
The foes of the king fall down and l\pointup{o}se heart.

Your throne, O God, shall endure for \pointup{e}ver.\Flex\\
A scepter of justice is the scepter \pointup{o}f your kingdom.\Med\\
Your love is for justice; your hatred f\pointup{o}r evil.

Therefore God, your God, has anointed y\pointup{o}u\Flex\\
with the oil of gladness above \pointup{o}ther kings:\Med\\
your robes are fragrant with aloes \pointup{a}nd myrrh.

From the ivory palace you are greeted with mus\pointup{\i}c.\Flex\\
The daughters of kings are am\pointup{o}ng your loved ones.\Med\\
On your right stands the queen in gold \pointup{o}f Ophir.

Glory to the Father and t\pointup{o} the Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginn\pointup{\i}ng, is now,\Med\\
and will be forever. \pointupl{A}men.
