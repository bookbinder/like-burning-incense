\FirstLetter{G}od is for us a refuge \pointup{a}nd strength,\Med\\
a helper close at hand, in time of d\pointup{i}stress,\\
so we shall not fear though the earth sh\pointup{o}uld rock,\Med\\
though the mountains fall into the depths of th\pointup{e} sea;\\
even though its waters rage \pointup{a}nd foam,\Med\\
even though the mountains be shaken by \pointup{i}ts waves.

The Lord of hosts is w\pointup{i}th us:\Med\\
the God of Jacob is \pointup{o}ur stronghold.

The waters of a river give joy to G\pointup{o}d’s city,\Med\\
the holy place where the Most H\pointup{i}gh dwells.\\
God is within, it cannot b\pointup{e} shaken;\Med\\
God will help it at the dawning of th\pointup{e} day.\\
Nations are in tumult, kingdoms \pointup{a}re shaken:\Med\\
he lifts his voice, the earth shrinks \pointup{a}way.

The Lord of hosts is w\pointup{i}th us:\Med\\
the God of Jacob is \pointup{o}ur stronghold.

Come, consider the works of th\pointup{e} Lord,\Med\\
the redoubtable deeds he has done on th\pointup{e} earth.\\
He puts an end to wars over all th\pointup{e} earth;\Med\\
the bow he breaks, the spear h\pointup{e} snaps.\\
He burns the shields with f\pointup{i}re.\Flex\\
“Be still and know that I \pointup{a}m God,\Med\\
supreme among the nations, supreme on th\pointup{e} earth!”

The Lord of hosts is w\pointup{i}th us:\Med\\
the God of Jacob is \pointup{o}ur stronghold.

Glory to the Father and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginning, \pointup{i}s now,\Med\\
and will be forever. \pointup{A}men.
