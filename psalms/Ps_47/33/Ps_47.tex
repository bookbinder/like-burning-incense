cry to God with shouts \pointup{o}f joy!\\
For the Lord, the Most High, we m\pointup{u}st fear,\Med\\

and nations under \pointup{o}ur feet.\\
Our inheritance, our glory, is fr\pointup{o}m him,\Med\\
given to Jacob out \pointup{o}f love.

God goes up with shouts \pointup{o}f joy;\Med\\
the Lord goes up with trump\pointup{e}t blast.\\
Sing praise for God, s\pointup{\i}ng praise,\Med\\
sing praise to our king, s\pointup{\i}ng praise.

God is king of all th\pointup{e} earth,\Med\\
sing praise with all y\pointup{o}ur skill.\\
God is king over th\pointup{e} nations;\Med\\
God reigns on his hol\pointup{y} throne.

The princes of the people are \pointup{a}ssembled\Med\\
with the people of Abrah\pointup{a}mâ€™s God.\\
The rulers of the earth belong t\pointup{o} God,\Med\\
to God who reigns ov\pointup{e}r all.

Glory to the Father and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginning, \pointup{\i}s now,\Med\\
and will be forever. \pointupl{A}men.
