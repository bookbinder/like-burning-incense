\FirstLetter{T}his is the lot of those who trust in th\pointup{e}mselves,\Med\\
who have others at their beck \pointup{a}nd call.\\
Like sheep they are driven to the gr\pointup{a}ve,\Flex\\
where death shall be th\pointup{e}ir shepherd\Med\\
and the just shall become th\pointup{e}ir rulers.

With the morning their outward sh\pointup{o}w vanishes\Med\\
and the grave becomes th\pointup{e}ir home.\\
But God will ransom me fr\pointup{o}m death\Med\\
and take my soul to h\pointup{\i}mself.

Then do not fear when a man gr\pointup{o}ws rich,\Med\\
when the glory of his house \pointup{\i}ncreases.\\
He takes nothing with him when h\pointup{e} dies,\Med\\
his glory does not follow him b\pointup{e}low.

Though he flattered himself while h\pointup{e} lived:\Med\\
“Men will praise me for all my s\pointup{u}ccess,”\\
yet he will go to join h\pointup{\i}s fathers,\Med\\
who will never see the light an\pointup{y} more.

In his riches, man l\pointup{a}cks wisdom:\Med\\
he is like the beasts that are d\pointup{e}stroyed.

Glory to the Father and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginning, \pointup{\i}s now,\Med\\
and will be forever. \pointupl{A}men.
