\FirstLetter{T}his is the lot of those who trust \pointup{\i}n themselves,\Med\\
who have others at their beck \pointup{a}nd call.\\
Like sheep they are driven to the gr\pointup{a}ve,\Flex\\
where death shall b\pointup{e} their shepherd\Med\\
and the just shall become th\pointup{e}ir rulers.

With the morning their outw\pointup{a}rd show vanishes\Med\\
and the grave becomes th\pointup{e}ir home.\\
But God will ransom m\pointup{e} from death\Med\\
and take my soul to h\pointup{\i}mself.

Then do not fear when a m\pointup{a}n grows rich,\Med\\
when the glory of his house \pointup{\i}ncreases.\\
He takes nothing with him wh\pointup{e}n he dies,\Med\\
his glory does not follow him b\pointup{e}low.

Though he flattered himself wh\pointup{\i}le he lived:\Med\\
“Men will praise me for all my s\pointup{u}ccess,”\\
yet he will go to j\pointup{o}in his fathers,\Med\\
who will never see the light an\pointup{y} more.

In his riches, m\pointup{a}n lacks wisdom:\Med\\
he is like the beasts that are d\pointup{e}stroyed.

Glory to the Father and t\pointup{o} the Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginn\pointup{\i}ng, is now,\Med\\
and will be forever. \pointupl{A}men.
