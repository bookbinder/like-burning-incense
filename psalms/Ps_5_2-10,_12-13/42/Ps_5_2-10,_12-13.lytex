    \FirstLetter{T}o my words give \pointup{e}ar, O Lord,\Med\\
    give heed to my gr\pointup{o}aning.\\
    Attend to the sound \pointup{o}f my cries,\Med\\
    my King and my G\pointup{o}d.

It is you whom I inv\pointup{o}ke, O Lord.\Med\\
    In the morning you h\pointup{e}ar me;\\
in the morning I offer y\pointup{o}u my prayer,\Med\\
    watching and w\pointup{a}iting.

You are no God wh\pointup{o} loves evil;\Med\\
    no sinner is yuur g\pointup{u}est.\\
The boastful shall not st\pointup{a}nd their ground\Med\\
    before your f\pointup{a}ce.

You hate all wh\pointup{o} do evil;\Med\\
    you destroy all who l\pointup{\i}e.\\
The deceitful and bloodth\pointup{\i}rsty man\Med\\
    the Lord det\pointup{e}sts.

But I through the greatness \pointup{o}f your love\Med\\
    have access to your h\pointup{o}use.\\
I bow down before your h\pointup{o}ly temple,\Med\\
    filled with \pointup{a}we.

Lead me, Lord, in your just\pointup{\i}ce,\Flex\\
    because of those who l\pointup{\i}e in wait;\Med\\
    make clear your way bef\pointup{o}re me.

No truth can be found \pointup{\i}n their mouths,\Med\\
    their heart is all m\pointup{\i}schief,\\
their throat a wide-\pointup{o}pen grave,\Med\\
    all honey their sp\pointup{e}ech.

All those you protect sh\pointup{a}ll be glad\Med\\
    and ring out their j\pointup{o}y.\\
You shelter them; in you th\pointup{e}y rejoice,\Med\\
    those who love your n\pointup{a}me.

It is you who bless the j\pointup{u}st man, Lord:\Med\\
    you surround him with favour as with a sh\pointup{\i}eld.

Glory to the Father and t\pointup{o} the Son,\Med\\
    and to the Holy Sp\pointup{\i}rit:\\
as it was in the beginn\pointup{\i}ng, is now,\Med\\
    and will be for ever. Am\pointup{e}n.
