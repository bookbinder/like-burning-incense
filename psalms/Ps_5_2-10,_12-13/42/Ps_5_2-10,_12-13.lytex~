To my words give ear, O Lord,
    give heed to my groaning.
Attend to the sound of my cries,
    my King and my God.

It is you whom I invoke, O Lord.
    In the morning you hear me;
in the morning I offer you my prayer,
    watching and waiting.

You are no God who loves evil;
    no sinner is your guest.
The boastful shall not stand their ground
    before your face.

You hate all who do evil;
    you destroy all who lie.
The deceitful and bloodthirsty man
    the Lord detests.

But I through the greatness of your love
    have access to your house.
I bow down before your holy temple,
    filled with awe.

Lead me, Lord, in your justice,
    because of those who lie in wait;
    make clear your way before me.

No truth can be found in their mouths,
    their heart is all mischief,
their throat a wide-open grave,
    all honey their speech.

All those you protect shall be glad
    and ring out their joy.
You shelter them; in you they rejoice,
    those who love your name.

It is you who bless the just man, Lord:
    you surround him with favour as with a shield.

Glory to the Father and to the Son,
    and to the Holy Spirit:
as it was in the beginning, is now,
    and will be for ever. Amen.
