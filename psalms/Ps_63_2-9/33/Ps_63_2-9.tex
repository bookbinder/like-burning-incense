    \FirstLetter{O} God, you are my God, for you \pointup{I} long;\Med\\
for you my soul \pointup{\i}s thirsting.\\
My body pines f\pointup{o}r you\Med\\
like a dry, weary land with\pointup{o}ut water.\\
So I gaze on you in the sanctu\pointup{a}ry\Med\\
to see your strength and y\pointup{o}ur glory.

For your love is better th\pointup{a}n life,\Med\\
my lips will speak y\pointup{o}ur praise.\\
So I will bless you all m\pointup{y} life,\Med\\
in your name I will lift up m\pointup{y} hands.\\
My soul shall be filled as with \pointup{a} banquet,\Med\\
my mouth shall praise you w\pointup{\i}th joy.

On my bed I rememb\pointup{e}r you.\Med\\
On you I muse through th\pointup{e} night\\
for you have been m\pointup{y} help;\Med\\
in the shadow of your wings I r\pointup{e}joice.\\
My soul clings t\pointup{o} you;\Med\\
your right hand holds m\pointup{e} fast.

Glory to the Father and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginning, \pointup{\i}s now,\Med\\
and will be forever. \pointupl{A}men.
