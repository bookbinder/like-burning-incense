    \FirstLetter{O} God, you are my God, for you \pointup{I} long;\Med\\
for you my s\pointup{o}ul is thirsting.\\
My body pines f\pointup{o}r you\Med\\
like a dry, weary land w\pointup{i}thout water.\\
So I gaze on you in the sanctu\pointup{a}ry\Med\\
to see your strength \pointup{a}nd your glory.

For your love is better th\pointup{a}n life,\Med\\
my lips will sp\pointup{e}ak your praise.\\
So I will bless you all m\pointup{y} life,\Med\\
in your name I will lift \pointup{u}p my hands.\\
My soul shall be filled as with \pointup{a} banquet,\Med\\
my mouth shall praise y\pointup{o}u with joy.

On my bed I rememb\pointup{e}r you.\Med\\
On you I muse thr\pointup{o}ugh the night\\
for you have been m\pointup{y} help;\Med\\
in the shadow of your wings \pointup{I} rejoice.\\
My soul clings t\pointup{o} you;\Med\\
your right hand h\pointup{o}lds me fast.

Glory to the Father and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
and to the H\pointup{o}ly Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginning, \pointup{\i}s now,\Med\\
and will be forev\pointup{e}r. Amen.
