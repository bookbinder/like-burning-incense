    \FirstLetter{O} God, you are my God, for y\pointup{o}u I long;\Med\\
for you my soul \pointup{\i}s thirsting.\\
My body p\pointup{\i}nes for you\Med\\
like a dry, weary land with\pointup{o}ut water.\\
So I gaze on you in the sanct\pointup{u}ary\Med\\
to see your strength and y\pointup{o}ur glory.

For your love is bett\pointup{e}r than life,\Med\\
my lips will speak y\pointup{o}ur praise.\\
So I will bless you \pointup{a}ll my life,\Med\\
in your name I will lift up m\pointup{y} hands.\\
My soul shall be filled as with \pointup{a} banquet,\Med\\
my mouth shall praise you w\pointup{\i}th joy.

On my bed I rem\pointup{e}mber you.\Med\\
On you I muse through th\pointup{e} night\\
for you have b\pointup{e}en my help;\Med\\
in the shadow of your wings I r\pointup{e}joice.\\
My soul cl\pointup{\i}ngs to you;\Med\\
your right hand holds m\pointup{e} fast.

Glory to the Father and t\pointup{o} the Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginn\pointup{\i}ng, is now,\Med\\
and will be forever. \pointup{A}men.
