    \FirstLetter{O} God, you are my God, for y\pointup{o}u I long;\Med\\
for you my s\pointup{o}ul is thirsting.\\
My body p\pointup{\i}nes for you\Med\\
like a dry, weary land w\pointup{i}thout water.\\
So I gaze on you in the sanct\pointup{u}ary\Med\\
to see your strength \pointup{a}nd your glory.

For your love is bett\pointup{e}r than life,\Med\\
my lips will sp\pointup{e}ak your praise.\\
So I will bless you \pointup{a}ll my life,\Med\\
in your name I will lift \pointup{u}p my hands.\\
My soul shall be filled as with \pointup{a} banquet,\Med\\
my mouth shall praise y\pointup{o}u with joy.

On my bed I rem\pointup{e}mber you.\Med\\
On you I muse thr\pointup{o}ugh the night\\
for you have b\pointup{e}en my help;\Med\\
in the shadow of your wings \pointup{I} rejoice.\\
My soul cl\pointup{\i}ngs to you;\Med\\
your right hand h\pointup{o}lds me fast.

Glory to the Father and t\pointup{o} the Son,\Med\\
and to the H\pointup{o}ly Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginn\pointup{\i}ng, is now,\Med\\
and will be forev\pointup{e}r. Amen.
