\FirstLetter{F}or he shall save the poor wh\pointup{e}n they cry\Med\\
and the needy who \pointup{a}re helpless.\\
He will have pity \pointup{o}n the weak\Med\\
and save the lives of th\pointup{e} poor.

From oppression he will resc\pointup{u}e their lives,\Med\\
to him their blood \pointup{\i}s dear.\\

may the gold of Sheba be giv\pointup{e}n him.\\
They shall pray for him with\pointup{o}ut ceasing\Med\\
and bless him all th\pointup{e} day.

May corn be abundant \pointup{\i}n the land\Med\\
to the peaks of th\pointup{e} mountains.\\
May its fruit rustle like Leban\pointup{o}n;\Flex\\
may people flourish \pointup{\i}n the cities\Med\\
like grass on th\pointup{e} earth.

May his name be bl\pointup{e}ssed for ever\Med\\
and endure like th\pointup{e} sun.\\
Every tribe shall be bl\pointup{e}ssed in him,\Med\\
all nations bless h\pointup{\i}s name.

Blessed be the Lord, G\pointup{o}d of Israel,\Med\\
who alone w\pointup{o}rks wonders,\\
ever blessed his glor\pointup{\i}ous name.\Med\\
Let his glory fill the earth. Amen! \pointupl{A}men!

Glory to the Father and t\pointup{o} the Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginn\pointup{\i}ng, is now,\Med\\
and will be forever. \pointupl{A}men.
