    \FirstLetter{I} cry aloud to God,\Med\\
cry aloud to God that he m\pointup{a}y hear me.

In the day of my distress I s\pointup{o}ught the Lord.\Flex\\
My hands were raised at night with\pointup{o}ut ceasing;\Med\\
my soul refused to b\pointup{e} consoled.\\
I remembered my God and \pointup{I} groaned.\Med\\
I pondered and my sp\pointup{i}rit fainted.

You withheld sleep from m\pointup{y} eyes.\Med\\
I was troubled, I could not speak.\\
I thought of the days of long ago\Med\\
and remembered the years long past.\\
At night I mused within my heart.\Med\\
I pondered and my spirit questioned.

“Will the Lord reject us for ever?\Med\\
Will he show us his favor no more?\\
Has his love vanished for ever?\Med\\
Has his promise come to an end?\\
Does God forget his mercy\Med\\
or in anger withhold his compassion?”

I said: “This is what causes my grief;\Med\\
that the way of the Most High has changed.”\\
I remember the deeds of the Lord,\Med\\
I remember your wonders of old,\\
I muse on all your works\Med\\
and ponder your mighty deeds.

Your ways, O God, are holy.\Med\\
What god is as great as our God?\\
You are the God who works wonders.\Med\\
You showed your power among the peoples.\\
Your strong arm redeemed your people,\Med\\
the sons of Jacob and Joseph.

The waters saw you, O God,\Med\\
the waters saw you and trembled;\\
the depths were moved with terror.\Med\\
The clouds poured down rain,\\
the skies sent forth their voice;\Med\\
your arrows flashed to and fro.

Your thunder rolled round the sky,\Med\\
your flashes lighted up the world.\\
The earth was moved and trembled\Med\\
when your way led through the sea,\\
your path through the mighty waters\Med\\
and no one saw your footprints.

You guided your people like a flock\Med\\
by the hand of Moses and Aaron.

Glory to the Father and to the Son,\Med\\
and to the Holy Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginning, is now,\Med\\
and will be forever. Amen.
