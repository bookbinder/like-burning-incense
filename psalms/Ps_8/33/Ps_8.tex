\FirstLetter{H}ow great is your name, O Lord \pointup{o}ur God,\Med\\
through all th\pointup{e} earth!

Your majesty is praised above th\pointup{e} heavens;\Med\\
on the lips of children and \pointup{o}f babes\\
you have found praise to foil y\pointup{o}ur enemy,\Med\\
to silence the foe and th\pointup{e} rebel.

When I see the heavens, the work of y\pointup{o}ur hands,\Med\\
the moon and the stars which you \pointup{a}rranged,\\
what is man that you should keep him \pointup{\i}n mind,\Med\\
mortal man that you care f\pointup{o}r him?

Yet you have made him little less than \pointup{a} god;\Med\\
with glory and honour y\pointup{o}u crowned him,\\
gave him power over the works of y\pointup{o}ur hand,\Med\\
put all things under h\pointup{\i}s feet.

All of them, sheep \pointup{a}nd cattle,\Med\\
yes, even the sav\pointup{a}ge beasts,\\
birds of the air, \pointup{a}nd fish\Med\\
that make their way through th\pointup{e} waters.

How great is your name, O Lord \pointup{o}ur God\Med\\
through all th\pointup{e} earth!

Glory to the Father and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginning, \pointup{\i}s now,\Med\\
and will be for ever. \pointupl{A}men.
