\FirstLetter{H}ow great is your name, O L\pointup{o}rd our God,\Med\\
through all th\pointup{e} earth!

Your majesty is praised ab\pointup{o}ve the heavens;\Med\\
on the lips of children and \pointup{o}f babes\\
you have found praise to f\pointup{o}il your enemy,\Med\\
to silence the foe and th\pointup{e} rebel.

When I see the heavens, the work \pointup{o}f your hands,\Med\\
the moon and the stars which you \pointup{a}rranged,\\
what is man that you should keep h\pointup{\i}m in mind,\Med\\
mortal man that you care f\pointup{o}r him?

Yet you have made him little less th\pointup{a}n a god;\Med\\
with glory and honour y\pointup{o}u crowned him,\\
gave him power over the works \pointup{o}f your hand,\Med\\
put all things under h\pointup{\i}s feet.

All of them, sh\pointup{e}ep and cattle,\Med\\
yes, even the sav\pointup{a}ge beasts,\\
birds of the \pointup{a}ir, and fish\Med\\
that make their way through th\pointup{e} waters.

How great is your name, O L\pointup{o}rd our God\\
through all th\pointup{e} earth!

Glory to the Father and t\pointup{o} the Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginn\pointup{\i}ng, is now,\Med\\
and will be for ever. \pointupl{A}men.
