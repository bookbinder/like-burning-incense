\FirstLetter{O} shepherd of Israel, hear us,\Med\\
you who lead Joseph’s flock,\\
shine forth from your cherubim throne\Med\\
upon Ephraim, Benjamin, Manasseh.\\
O Lord, rouse up your might,\Med\\
O Lord, come to our help.

God of hosts bring us back;\Med\\
let your face shine on us and we shall be saved.

Lord God of hosts, how long\Med\\
will you frown on your people’s plea?\\
You have fed them with tears for their bread,\Med\\
an abundance of tears for their drink.\\
You have made us the taunt of our neighbors,\Med\\
our enemies laugh us to scorn.

God of hosts, bring us back;\Med\\
let your face shine on us and we shall be saved.

You brought a vine out of Egypt;\Med\\
to plant it you drove out the nations.\\
Before it you cleared the ground;\Med\\
it took root and spread through the land.

The mountains were covered with its shadow,\Med\\
the cedars of God with its boughs.\\
It stretched out its branches to the sea,\Med\\
to the Great River it stretched out its shoots.

Then why have you broken down its walls?\Med\\
It is plucked by all who pass by.\\
It is ravaged by the boar of the forest,\Med\\
devoured by the beasts of the field.

God of hosts, turn again, we implore,\Med\\
look down from heaven and see.\\
Visit the vine and protect it,\Med\\
the vine your right hand has planted.\\
Men have burnt it with fire and destroyed it.\Med\\
May they perish at the frown of your face.

May your hand be on the man you have chosen,\Med\\
the man you have given your strength.\\
And we shall never forsake you again;\Med\\
give us life that we may call upon your name.

God of hosts, bring us back;\Med\\
let your face shine on us and we shall be saved.

Glory to the Father and to the Son,\Med\\
and to the Holy Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginning, is now,\Med\\
and will be forever. Amen.
