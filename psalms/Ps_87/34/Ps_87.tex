\FirstLetter{O}n the holy mountain is h\pointup{\i}s city\Med\\
cherished b\pointup{y} the Lord.\\
The Lord prefers the gates \pointup{o}f Zion\Med\\
to all J\pointup{a}cob’s dwellings.\\
Of you are told glori\pointup{o}us things,\Med\\
O cit\pointup{y} of God!

Babylon and Egypt I w\pointup{\i}ll count\Med\\
among th\pointup{o}se who know me;\\
Philistia, Tyre, Eth\pointup{\i}opia,\Med\\
these will b\pointup{e} her children\\
and Zion shall be c\pointup{a}lled “Mother”\Med\\
for all shall b\pointup{e} her children.”

It is he, the Lord M\pointup{o}st High,\Med\\
who gives \pointup{e}ach his place.\\
In his register of peoples h\pointup{e} writes:\Med\\
“These \pointup{a}re her children,”\\
and while they dance they w\pointup{\i}ll sing:\Med\\
“In you all f\pointup{\i}nd their home.”

Glory to the Father and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
and to the H\pointup{o}ly Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginning, \pointup{\i}s now,\Med\\
and will be forev\pointup{e}r. Amen.
