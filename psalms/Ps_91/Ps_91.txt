Psalm 90 (91)
The protection of the Most High
“Behold, I have given you power to tread under foot both serpents and scorpions” (Lk 10:19).

He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High
    and abides in the shade of the Almighty
says to the Lord: ‘My refuge,
    my stronghold, my God in whom I trust!’

It is he who will free you from the snare
    of the fowler who seeks to destroy you;
he will conceal you with his pinions
    and under his wings you will find refuge.

You will not fear the terror of the night
    nor the arrow that flies by day,
nor the plague that prowls in the darkness
    nor the scourge that lays waste at noon.

A thousand may fall at your side,
    ten thousand fall at your right,
you, it will never approach;
    his faithfulness is buckler and shield.

Your eyes have only to look
    to see how the wicked are repaid,
you who have said: ‘Lord, my refuge!’
    and have made the Most High your dwelling.

Upon you no evil shall fall,
    no plague approach where you dwell.
For you has he commanded his angels,
    to keep you in all your ways.

They shall bear you upon their hands
    lest you strike your foot against a stone.
On the lion and the viper you will tread
    and trample the young lion and the dragon.

Since he clings to me in love, I will free him;
    protect him for he knows my name.
When he calls I shall answer: ‘I am with you,’
    I will save him in distress and give him glory.

With length of life I will content him;
    I shall let him see my saving power.

Glory to the Father and to the Son,
    and to the Holy Spirit:
as it was in the beginning, is now,
    and will be for ever. Amen.
