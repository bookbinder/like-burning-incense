It is good to give thanks to th\pointup{e} Lord,\Med\\
    to make music to your name, O M\pointup{o}st High,
to proclaim your love in th\pointup{e} morning\Med\\
    and your truth in the watches of th\pointup{e} night,\\
on the ten-stringed lyre and th\pointup{e} lute,\Med\\
    with the murmuring sound of th\pointup{e} harp.

Your deeds, O Lord, have made m\pointup{e} glad;\Med\\
    for the work of your hands I shout w\pointup{\i}th joy.\\
O Lord, how great are y\pointup{o}ur works!\Med\\
    How deep are your d\pointup{e}signs!\\
The foolish man cannot kn\pointup{o}w this\Med\\
    and the fool cannot und\pointup{e}rstand.

Though the wicked spring up l\pointup{\i}ke grass\Med\\
    and all who do ev\pointup{\i}l thrive,\\
they are doomed to be eternally d\pointup{e}stroyed.\Med\\
    But you, Lord, are eternally \pointup{o}n high.\\
See how your enem\pointup{\i}es perish;\Med\\
    all doers of evil \pointup{a}re scattered.

To me you give the wild oxâ€™\pointup{s} strength;\Med\\
    you anoint me with the pur\pointup{e}st oil.\\
My eyes looked in triumph on m\pointup{y} foes;\Med\\
    my ears heard gladly of th\pointup{e}ir fall.\\
The just will flourish like th\pointup{e} palm-tree\Med\\
    and grow like a Leban\pointup{o}n cedar.

Planted in the house of th\pointup{e} Lord\Med\\
    they will flourish in the courts of \pointup{o}ur God,
still bearing fruit when they \pointup{a}re old,\Med\\
    still full of sap, st\pointup{\i}ll green,\\
to proclaim that the Lord \pointup{\i}s just.\Med\\
    In him, my rock, there is n\pointup{o} wrong.

Glory to the Father and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
    and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginning, \pointup{\i}s now,\Med\\
    and will be for ever. \pointupl{A}men.
