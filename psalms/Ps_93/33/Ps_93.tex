\FirstLetter{T}he Lord is king, with majesty enr\pointup{o}bed;\Flex\\
    the Lord has robed himself w\pointup{\i}th might,\Med\\
    he has girded himself w\pointup{\i}th power.

The world you made firm, not to be m\pointup{o}ved;\Flex\\
    your throne has stood firm from \pointup{o}f old.\Med\\
    From all eternity, O Lord, y\pointup{o}u are.

The waters have lifted up, O L\pointup{o}rd,\Flex\\
    the waters have lifted up th\pointup{e}ir voice,\Med\\
    the waters have lifted up th\pointup{e}ir thunder.

Greater than the roar of mighty wat\pointup{e}rs\Flex\\
    more glorious than the surgings of th\pointup{e} sea,\Med\\
    the Lord is glorious \pointup{o}n high.

Truly your decrees are to be trust\pointup{e}d.\Flex\\
    Holiness is fitting to y\pointup{o}ur house,\Med\\
    O Lord, until the end \pointup{o}f time.

Glory be to the Father and to th\pointup{e} Son\Med\\
    and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit;\\
as it was in the beginning, \pointup{\i}s now,\Med\\
    and will be for ever, \pointupl{A}men.
