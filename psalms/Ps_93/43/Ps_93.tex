\FirstLetter{T}he Lord is king, with majesty enr\pointup{o}bed;\Flex\\
    the Lord has robed hims\pointup{e}lf with might,\Med\\
    he has girded himself w\pointup{\i}th power.

The world you made firm, not to be m\pointup{o}ved;\Flex\\
    your throne has stood firm fr\pointup{o}m of old.\Med\\
    From all eternity, O Lord, y\pointup{o}u are.

The waters have lifted up, O L\pointup{o}rd,\Flex\\
    the waters have lifted \pointup{u}p their voice,\Med\\
    the waters have lifted up th\pointup{e}ir thunder.

Greater than the roar of mighty wat\pointup{e}rs\Flex\\
    more glorious than the surgings \pointup{o}f the sea,\Med\\
    the Lord is glorious \pointup{o}n high.

Truly your decrees are to be trust\pointup{e}d.\Flex\\
    Holiness is fitting t\pointup{o} your house,\Med\\
    O Lord, until the end \pointup{o}f time.

Glory be to the Father and t\pointup{o} the Son\Med\\
    and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit;\\
as it was in the beginn\pointup{\i}ng, is now,\Med\\
    and will be for ever, \pointupl{A}men.
