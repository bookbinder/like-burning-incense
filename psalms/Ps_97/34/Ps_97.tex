    \FirstLetter{T}he Lord is king, let \pointup{e}arth rejoice,\Med\\
let all the coastl\pointup{a}nds be glad.\\
Cloud and darkness \pointup{a}re his raiment;\Med\\
his throne, just\pointup{\i}ce and right.

A fire prep\pointup{a}res his path;\Med\\
it burns up his foes on \pointup{e}very side.\\
His lightnings light \pointup{u}p the world,\Med\\
the earth trembles \pointup{a}t the sight.

The mountains m\pointup{e}lt like wax\Med\\
before the Lord of \pointup{a}ll the earth.\\
The skies procl\pointup{a}im his justice;\Med\\
all peoples s\pointup{e}e his glory.

Let those who serve idols be ash\pointup{a}med,\Flex\\
those who boast of their w\pointup{o}rthless gods.\Med\\
All you spirits, w\pointup{o}rship him.

Zion hears and is gl\pointup{a}d;\Flex\\
the people of Jud\pointup{a}h rejoice\Med\\
because of your judgm\pointup{e}nts, O Lord.

For you indeed are the L\pointup{o}rd\Flex\\
most high ab\pointup{o}ve all the earth,\Med\\
exalted far ab\pointup{o}ve all spirits.

The Lord loves those who hate ev\pointup{\i}l;\Flex\\
he guards the souls \pointup{o}f his saints;\Med\\
he sets them free fr\pointup{o}m the wicked.

Light shines forth f\pointup{o}r the just\Med\\
and joy for the upr\pointup{\i}ght of heart.\\
Rejoice, you just, \pointup{\i}n the Lord;\Med\\
give glory to his h\pointup{o}ly name.

Glory to the Father and t\pointup{o} the Son,\Med\\
and to the H\pointup{o}ly Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginn\pointup{\i}ng, is now,\Med\\
and will be forev\pointup{e}r. Amen.
