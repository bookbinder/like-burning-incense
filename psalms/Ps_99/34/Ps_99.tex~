\FirstLetter{T}he Lord is king; the peoples trembl\pointup{e}.\Flex\\
He is throned on the cherubim; the \pointup{e}arth quakes.\Med\\
The Lord is great \pointup{\i}n Zion.

He is supreme over all the peopl\pointup{e}s.\Flex\\
Let them praise his name, so terrible \pointup{a}nd great,\Med\\
he is holy, full \pointup{o}f power.

You are a king who loves what is r\pointup{\i}ght;\Flex\\
you have established equity, justice \pointup{a}nd right;\Med\\
you have established them \pointup{\i}n Jacob.

Exalt the Lord our G\pointup{o}d;\Flex\\
bow down before Zion, h\pointup{\i}s footstool.\Med\\
He the Lord \pointup{\i}s holy.

Among his priests were Aaron and Mos\pointup{e}s,\Flex\\
among those who invoked his name w\pointup{a}s Samuel.\Med\\
They invoked the Lord and h\pointup{e} answered.

To them he spoke in the pillar of cl\pointup{o}ud.\Flex\\
They did his will; they kept th\pointup{e} law,\Med\\
which he, the Lord, h\pointup{a}d given.

O Lord our God, you answered th\pointup{e}m.\Flex\\
For them you were a God who f\pointup{o}rgives;\Med\\
yet you punished their \pointup{o}ffenses.

Exalt the Lord our G\pointup{o}d;\Flex\\
bow down before his hol\pointup{y} mountain\Med\\
for the Lord our God \pointup{\i}s holy.

Glory to the Father and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginning, \pointup{\i}s now,\Med\\
and will be forever. \pointupl{A}men.
