\FirstLetter{W}e praise you, the Lord God \pointup{A}lmighty,\Med\\
who is and wh\pointup{o} was.\\
You have assumed your gr\pointup{e}at power,\Med\\
you have begun y\pointup{o}ur reign.

The nations have raged in ang\pointup{e}r,\Flex\\
but then came your day \pointup{o}f wrath\Med\\
and the moment to judge th\pointup{e} dead:\\
The time to reward your servants the proph\pointup{e}ts\Flex\\
and the holy ones who r\pointup{e}vere you,\Med\\
the great and the small \pointup{a}like.

Now have salvation and power c\pointup{o}me,\Flex\\
the reign of our God and the \pointup{a}uthority\Med\\
of his Anoint\pointup{e}d One.\\
For the accuser of our brothers is c\pointup{a}st out,\Med\\
who night and day accused them bef\pointup{o}re God.

They defeated him by the blood of the L\pointup{a}mb\Flex\\
and by the word of th\pointup{e}ir testimony;\Med\\
love for life did not deter them fr\pointup{o}m death.\\
So rejoice, y\pointup{o}u heavens,\Med\\
and you that dwell th\pointup{e}rein!

Glory to the Father and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginning, \pointup{i}s now,\Med\\
and will be forever. \pointup{A}men.
