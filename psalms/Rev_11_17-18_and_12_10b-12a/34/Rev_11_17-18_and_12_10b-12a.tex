\FirstLetter{W}e praise you, the Lord God \pointup{A}lmighty,\Med\\
who is \pointup{a}nd who was.\\
You have assumed your gr\pointup{e}at power,\Med\\
you have beg\pointup{u}n your reign.

The nations have raged in ang\pointup{e}r,\Flex\\
but then came your day \pointup{o}f wrath\Med\\
and the moment to j\pointup{u}dge the dead:\\
The time to reward your servants the proph\pointup{e}ts\Flex\\
and the holy ones who r\pointup{e}vere you,\Med\\
the great and the sm\pointup{a}ll alike.

Now have salvation and power c\pointup{o}me,\Flex\\
the reign of our God and the \pointup{a}uthority\Med\\
of his An\pointup{o}inted One.\\
For the accuser of our brothers is c\pointup{a}st out,\Med\\
who night and day accused them b\pointup{e}fore God.

They defeated him by the blood of the L\pointup{a}mb\Flex\\
and by the word of th\pointup{e}ir testimony;\Med\\
love for life did not deter th\pointup{e}m from death.\\
So rejoice, y\pointup{o}u heavens,\Med\\
and you that dw\pointup{e}ll therein!

Glory to the Father and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
and to the H\pointup{o}ly Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginning, \pointup{i}s now,\Med\\
and will be forev\pointup{e}r. Amen.
