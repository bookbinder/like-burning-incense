\FirstLetter{W}e praise you, the Lord G\pointup{o}d Almighty,\Med\\
who is and wh\pointup{o} was.\\
You have assumed y\pointup{o}ur great power,\Med\\
you have begun y\pointup{o}ur reign.

The nations have raged in ang\pointup{e}r,\Flex\\
but then came your d\pointup{a}y of wrath\Med\\
and the moment to judge th\pointup{e} dead:\\
The time to reward your servants the proph\pointup{e}ts\Flex\\
and the holy ones wh\pointup{o} revere you,\Med\\
the great and the small \pointup{a}like.

Now have salvation and power c\pointup{o}me,\Flex\\
the reign of our God and th\pointup{e} authority\Med\\
of his Anoint\pointup{e}d One.\\
For the accuser of our brothers \pointup{\i}s cast out,\Med\\
who night and day accused them bef\pointup{o}re God.

They defeated him by the blood of the L\pointup{a}mb\Flex\\
and by the word \pointup{o}f their testimony;\Med\\
love for life did not deter them fr\pointup{o}m death.\\
So rej\pointup{o}ice, you heavens,\Med\\
and you that dwell th\pointup{e}rein!

Glory to the Father and t\pointup{o} the Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginn\pointup{\i}ng, is now,\Med\\
and will be forever. \pointupl{A}men.
