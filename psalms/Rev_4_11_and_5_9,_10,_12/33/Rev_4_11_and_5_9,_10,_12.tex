Worthy are you, \pointup{O} Lord,\Med\\

For you w\pointup{e}re slain;\Med\\
with your blood you purchased f\pointup{o}r God\\
men of every race \pointup{a}nd tongue,\Med\\
of every people \pointup{a}nd nation.

You made of them a kingd\pointup{o}m,\Flex\\
and priests to serve \pointup{o}ur God,\Med\\
and they shall reign on th\pointup{e} earth.

Worthy is the Lamb that w\pointup{a}s slain\Med\\

Glory to the Father and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
