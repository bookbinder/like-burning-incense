\FirstLetter{O} Lord our God, y\pointup{o}u are worthy\Med\\
to receive glory and honor and p\pointup{o}wer.

For you have creat\pointup{e}d all things;\Med\\
by your will they came to be and were m\pointup{a}de.

Worthy are y\pointup{o}u, O Lord,\Med\\
to receive the scroll and break open its s\pointup{e}als.

For y\pointup{o}u were slain;\Med\\
with your blood you purchased for G\pointup{o}d\\
men of every r\pointup{a}ce and tongue,\Med\\
of every people and n\pointup{a}tion.

You made of them a kingd\pointup{o}m,\Flex\\
and priests to s\pointup{e}rve our God,\Med\\
and they shall reign on the \pointup{e}arth.

Worthy is the Lamb th\pointup{a}t was slain\Med\\
to receive power and r\pointup{i}ches,\Med\\
wisd\pointup{o}m and strength,\\
honor and glory and pr\pointup{a}ise.

Glory to the Father and t\pointup{o} the Son,\Med\\
and to the Holy Sp\pointup{i}rit:\\
as it was in the beginn\pointup{i}ng, is now,\Med\\
and will be forever. Am\pointup{e}n.
