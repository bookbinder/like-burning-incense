\FirstLetter{C}ome to our aid, O God of th\pointup{e} universe,\Med\\
and put all the nations in dread \pointup{o}f you!\\
Raise your hand against th\pointup{e} heathen,\Med\\
that they may realize y\pointup{o}ur power.

As you have used us to show them y\pointup{o}ur holiness,\Med\\
so now use them to show us y\pointup{o}ur glory.\\
Thus they will know, as w\pointup{e} know,\Med\\
that there is no God b\pointup{u}t you.

Give new signs and work n\pointup{e}w wonders;\Med\\
show forth the splendor of your right hand \pointup{a}nd arm.

Gather all the tribes \pointup{o}f Jacob,\Med\\
that they may inherit the land as \pointup{o}f old.\\
Show mercy to the people called by y\pointup{o}ur name;\Med\\
Israel, whom you named your f\pointup{\i}rst-born.

Take pity on your hol\pointup{y} city,\Med\\
Jerusalem, your dwell\pointup{\i}ng place.\\
Fill Zion with y\pointup{o}ur majesty,\Med\\
your temple with y\pointup{o}ur glory.

Glory to the Father and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginning, \pointup{\i}s now,\Med\\
and will be forever. \pointupl{A}men.
