\FirstLetter{C}ome to our aid, O God \pointup{o}f the universe,\Med\\
and put all the nations in dread \pointup{o}f you!\\
Raise your hand ag\pointup{a}inst the heathen,\Med\\
that they may realize y\pointup{o}ur power.

As you have used us to show th\pointup{e}m your holiness,\Med\\
so now use them to show us y\pointup{o}ur glory.\\
Thus they will know, \pointup{a}s we know,\Med\\
that there is no God b\pointup{u}t you.

Give new signs and w\pointup{o}rk new wonders;\Med\\
show forth the splendor of your right hand \pointup{a}nd arm.

Gather all the tr\pointup{\i}bes of Jacob,\Med\\
that they may inherit the land as \pointup{o}f old.\\
Show mercy to the people called b\pointup{y} your name;\Med\\
Israel, whom you named your f\pointup{\i}rst-born.

Take pity on your h\pointup{o}ly city,\Med\\
Jerusalem, your dwell\pointup{\i}ng place.\\
Fill Zion w\pointup{\i}th your majesty,\Med\\
your temple with y\pointup{o}ur glory.

Glory to the Father and t\pointup{o} the Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginn\pointup{\i}ng, is now,\Med\\
and will be forever. \pointupl{A}men.
