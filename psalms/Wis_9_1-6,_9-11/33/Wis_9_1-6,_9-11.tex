\FirstLetter{G}od of my fathers, Lord \pointup{o}f mercy,\Med\\
you who have made all things by y\pointup{o}ur word\\
and in your wisdom have establ\pointup{\i}shed men\Med\\
to rule the creatures produced b\pointup{y} you,\\
to govern the world in holiness \pointup{a}nd justice,\Med\\
and to render judgment in integrity \pointup{o}f heart:

Give me Wisdom, the attendant at y\pointup{o}ur throne,\Med\\
and reject me not from among y\pointup{o}ur children:\\
for I am your servant, the son of your handm\pointup{a}id,\Flex\\
a man weak and sh\pointup{o}rt-lived\Med\\
and lacking in comprehension of judgment and \pointup{o}f laws.

Indeed, though one be perfect among the sons of m\pointup{e}n,\Flex\\
if Wisdom, who comes from you, be not w\pointup{\i}th him,\Med\\
he shall be held in no \pointup{e}steem.

Now with you is Wisdom who knows y\pointup{o}ur works\Med\\
and was present when you made th\pointup{e} world;\\
who understands what is pleasing in y\pointup{o}ur eyes\Med\\
and what is conformable with your c\pointup{o}mmands.

Send her forth from your hol\pointup{y} heavens\Med\\
and from your glorious throne d\pointup{\i}spatch her\\
that she may be with me and work w\pointup{\i}th me,\Med\\
that I may know what is y\pointup{o}ur pleasure.

For she knows and understands all th\pointup{\i}ngs,\Flex\\
and will guide me discreetly in my \pointup{a}ffairs\Med\\
and safeguard me by h\pointup{e}r glory.

Glory to the Father, and to th\pointup{e} Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginning, \pointup{\i}s now,\Med\\
and will be for ever. \pointupl{A}men
