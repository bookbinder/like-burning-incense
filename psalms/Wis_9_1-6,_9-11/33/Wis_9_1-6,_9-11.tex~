\FirstLetter{G}od of my fathers, L\pointup{o}rd of mercy,\Med\\
you who have made all things by y\pointup{o}ur word\\
and in your wisdom have est\pointup{a}blished mane\Med\\
to rule the creatures produced b\pointup{y} you,\\
to govern the world in holin\pointup{e}ss and justice,\Med\\
and to render judgment in integrity \pointup{o}f heart:

Give me Wisdom, the attendant \pointup{a}t your throne,\Med\\
and reject me not from among y\pointup{o}ur children:\\
for I am your servant, the son of your handm\pointup{a}id,\Flex\\
a man weak \pointup{a}nd short-lived\Med\\
and lacking in comprehension of judgment and \pointup{o}f laws.

Indeed, though one be perfect among the sons of m\pointup{e}n,\Flex\\
if Wisdom, who comes from you, be n\pointup{o}t with him,\Med\\
he shall be held in no \pointup{e}steem.

Now with you is Wisdom who kn\pointup{o}ws your works\Med\\
and was present when you made th\pointup{e} world;\\
who understands what is pleasing \pointup{\i}n your eyes\Med\\
and what is conformable with your c\pointup{o}mmands.

Send her forth from your h\pointup{o}ly heavens\Med\\
and from your glorious throne d\pointup{\i}spatch her\\
that she may be with me and w\pointup{o}rk with me,\Med\\
that I may know what is y\pointup{o}ur pleasure.

For she knows and understands all th\pointup{\i}ngs,\Flex\\
and will guide me discreetly in m\pointup{y} affairs\Med\\
and safeguard me by h\pointup{e}r glory.

Glory to the Father, and t\pointup{o} the Son,\Med\\
and to the Hol\pointup{y} Spirit:\\
as it was in the beginn\pointup{\i}ng, is now,\Med\\
and will be for ever. \pointupl{A}men
