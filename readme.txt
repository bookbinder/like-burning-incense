# The Original Project

The original handwritten project is available at [Dropbox here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/f4wwbcx3ox2lr1a/AACSsf0c_C3QVPCTAif1mj5Ka).

(Quoting from the original Antiphonary:)

> Monastery of the Blessed Sacrament  
> Cloistered Dominican Nuns  
> 29575 Middlebelt Road  
> Farmington Hills, MI, 48018  
> 
> NAME: We have given the name LIKE BURNING INCENSE to this Antiphonary.
> 
> CONTENTS: Musical settings for all the texts of the four-volume Breviary (with
> the exception of the Office of Readings).
> 
> COMPOSER: A trappist monk who is extraordinarily gifted. He wishes to remain in
> anonymity.
> 
> STYLE OF MUSIC: English chant form.
> 
> PSALM TONES: These are indicated at the end of each Antiphon by a little
> musical formula or pattern. A sheet explaining the method of pointing the text
> of the psalm as well as how to interpret the psalm-tone pattern is enclosed.
> 
> PRICE: There is no charge for this music. Some communities have wished to offer
> donations to help with the expenses of printing and mailing, etc. These we
> accept with deep gratitude, but we do not ask any monetary return for what we
> are so privileged to share.
> 
> PSALMS: We do not print the psalms. All of us simply use our Breviaries for the
> singing of the psalms. Here we marked the accents when we received our
> Breviaries. However, after a rather short time, we found that it is not
> necessary to mark all the accents -- one becomes so used to them. From there on
> we marked only the “unusual” accents. (Please see the Psalm Tone explanation
> sheet regarding these.)
> 
> OUR WORK ON THIS PROJECT: As you will notice, we have been graciously given the
> copyright on this music. Our aim in accepting this copyright is to protect the
> music from being taken over, perhaps by some rather unscrupulous publisher.
> Father does not want his music in the hands of a publisher to be sold. Father
> has sent on to us all his manuscript copies of the music. Our work is to retype
> texts AND notation, make masters for printing, and then collate and send on the
> music to all on our mailing list. This work must be fitted into our monastic
> schedule; and so progress is rather slow. We would want all of you to
> understand our situation in this regard.


# My changes

Where antiphons and psalm tones had more than four sharps or flats, I transposed them down a half step to a more ordinary key.
