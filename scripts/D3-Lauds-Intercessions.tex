By his own power Christ raised up the temple of his body when it had been destroyed in death. With joy let us ask him:\\
\emph{Lord, share with us the fruits of your victory.}

\medskip
Christ our Savior, when you rose again you brought to the holy women and the apostles the joyful news of a world redeemed,\\
{\color{red}---}make us witnesses to your risen life.

\medskip
You promised to all people that we would rise up again to newness of life,\\
{\color{red}---}make us heralds of your Gospel.

\medskip
You showed yourself to your apostles and breathed the Holy Spirit on them,\\
{\color{red}---}renew in us the presence of the same creator Spirit.

\medskip
You promised to be with your disciples to the end of the world,\\
{\color{red}---}stay with us today, and remain with us always.
